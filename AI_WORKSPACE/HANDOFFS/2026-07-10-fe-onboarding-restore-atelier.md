## ⚠️ Evidence correction (2026-07-10) — read before using the "completion signal" notes below

The original evidence in this handoff called `ProfileResponse.profile_exists` the
"canonical completion signal." **That is wrong.** The rest of this file is kept verbatim
for traceability, but where it conflicts with this correction, **this correction wins.**
See the matching correction block in `DEC-20260710-004`.

- **`profile_exists` = career data exists; it does NOT mean onboarding is complete.**
  A partial profile, a merged-guest profile, one skill, one target role, or CV evidence
  all make it `True`. Do not route solely on it (evidence #2, #4, plan step #4 below are
  corrected by this note).
- **Persisted onboarding status is the primary completion signal** —
  `rico_onboarding_states` (`pending` / `in_progress` / `completed`) via
  `get_onboarding_state` / `is_onboarding_complete` / `set_onboarding_status`.
- **The backend minimum-profile gate is the canonical readiness evaluation** —
  `src/services/profile_context_resolver.py::evaluate_minimum_profile`. `POST
  /api/v1/onboarding/submit` already runs it and persists `completed` / `in_progress`.
- **No frontend duplication of `evaluate_minimum_profile`.** Next.js must NOT re-implement
  completion rules; it reads them from the backend.
- **Exposed signal:** `GET /api/v1/onboarding/status` (read-only, authenticated) returns
  `{status, complete, source, missing_fields, profile_exists, profile_completeness}`.
  Frontend routing: after login/submit and on direct `/onboarding` visits, call this
  endpoint and route `complete=true → /command`, `complete=false → /onboarding`. Users
  with no `rico_onboarding_states` row resolve via the gate with `source:"derived_legacy"`
  (a GET never backfills). On a status-request failure, show a recoverable UI
  (Retry / Continue to Rico) — no redirect loop, no false completion claim.
- **Filename correction:** the redirect line is in **`apps/web/next.config.js`** (this
  handoff and the DEC originally wrote `next.config` / `next.config.mjs`). It is line ~81:
  `{ source: "/onboarding", destination: "/command", permanent: false }`.
- **Delivery (this branch/PR):** shipped as ONE focused PR on
  `claude/onboarding-completion-signal-j8qmxz` (branched from `main` @ `c43bedc`, which
  already carries the Atelier token/island layer). Contents: this DEC/handoff correction,
  the read-only `GET /api/v1/onboarding/status` endpoint + backend tests, the frontend
  `fetchOnboardingStatus` client + typed schema, the `/onboarding` Atelier migration
  (`app/_atelier/atelier-onboarding.css` + rewritten `app/onboarding/page.tsx`), the
  removed `/onboarding → /command` redirect in `apps/web/next.config.js`, post-login
  routing on the completion signal, and frontend tests. No completion logic is duplicated
  in Next.js — the UI reads `/onboarding/status`.

## Overall design-migration status (approved `/design-preview` Atelier direction)

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Landing | ✅ done (pre-existing) |
| **Auth** (`/login`,`/signup`,`/forgot-password`,`/reset-password`,`/verify-email`) | ✅ **merged (PR #948, `be312e8`) + production-verified** |
| **Support/contact + Legal** (`/faq`,`/contact`; legal already Atelier) | ✅ **merged (PR #949, `58f46632`) + production-verified** |
| Auth docs bookkeeping | ✅ merged (PR #950, `c43bedc`) |
| **Onboarding** | 🔶 **IN PROGRESS — this handoff** |
| Workspace shell → Dashboard → Profile → Settings → Applications/Flow → Upload CV → Subscription → Command/Chat (last) | ⏳ not started (do NOT start workspace until onboarding PR merged + prod-verified) |

Established Atelier pattern (reuse it): scoped `.atelier` island under `app/_atelier/atelier-tokens.css`
+ per-surface CSS (`atelier-auth.css`, `atelier-support.css`). Shipped examples: `/terms`, `/privacy`,
`/faq`, `/contact` use `.atelier atl-doc`; auth uses `components/auth/AtelierAuthShell.tsx`. Palette:
paper `#f2ece0` / ink `#14110d` / sun-red `#cf3d17`; serif display (Georgia fallback), mono labels.
Verified Atelier dark = `data-atl-theme="dark"` (existing night palette — do not invent new dark colors).

## Owner decision (DEC-20260710-004, accepted)

Option 1 — re-enable + migrate `/onboarding`. Full required flow + rules are in the DEC. Key points:
- Remove **only** the `/onboarding → /command` redirect (`apps/web/next.config`, currently line ~81). Keep every other deprecated-route redirect.
- Gate routing on onboarding completion: incomplete → `/onboarding`; complete → `/command`; after finish → `/command`; "Skip for now" → `/command` (no false completion); completed users never forced back through onboarding.
- Do NOT redesign `/command`. Do NOT change backend APIs / Neon schema / billing / provider routing.

## Repository evidence gathered (verified this session)

1. **Redirect location:** `apps/web/next.config` (mjs) `async redirects()` array, line ~81:
   `{ source: "/onboarding", destination: "/command", permanent: false }`. Server-side 307 → page is unreachable. Remove ONLY this line. (Siblings `/dashboard`,`/jobs`,`/signals`,`/archive`,`/saved-searches`,`/orchestrate` stay.)
2. **Canonical completion signal:** `GET /api/v1/rico/profile` → `ProfileResponse.profile_exists: boolean` (`apps/web/lib/api.ts:237`, fetch at `:264`). **This is the existing signal — use it. Do NOT invent a new flag/schema.**
3. **`/api/v1/me` has NO onboarding flag:** `MeResponse` = `{ email, role, authenticated, guest?, name? }` (`api.ts:178`). So completion must be read from `getProfile()`/`profile_exists`, not `/me`.
4. **Existing onboarding page** (`apps/web/app/onboarding/page.tsx`, 466 lines, dark/Nocturne) already implements the REAL flow — preserve its behavior, restyle to Atelier:
   - Auth guard: `fetchMe()` → if `!authenticated` → `router.replace(buildAuthHref("/signup","/onboarding"))`.
   - Upload: `uploadCV(file)`; accepted types = pdf/doc/docx/jpeg/png/webp; **non-CV rejection** = `res.status === "classified" && res.document_type !== "cv"` → error `onboardingErrNotCv`; 413 → `cmdCvTooLarge`; auth failure → `router.replace(loginHref)`.
   - States: `PageState = upload | parsing | form | submitting | done | error`; `StepIndicator` (Upload → Complete → Ready).
   - Form: prefill `skills` from parsed CV; fields `target_roles, preferred_cities, salary_expectation_aed, years_experience, skills` (list/number parsing preserved).
   - Submit: `submitOnboarding(payload)` → `done`; failure keeps `form` state + error (**must not show success on failure**).
5. **Misleading destinations to fix (3 usages in onboarding/page.tsx):** `/dashboard?skip=1` at lines ~343 (have-profile link), ~414 (Skip for now), ~434 (CompletionCard onGo). Per DEC → route these to **`/command`**. (`/dashboard` itself redirects to `/command`; `?skip=1` falsely implies completion.)
6. **Post-signup routing today:** `components/auth/SignupForm.tsx` does `router.push('/onboarding')` on the no-verification path (currently bounces to `/command` via the redirect). After removing the redirect this reaches onboarding. Verify the verification→login return path (`buildAuthHref` / `lib/redirect.ts`) preserves intended return to `/onboarding`.
7. **Guest→auth merge:** check how `public_user_id_to_merge` (used in `login()`/`register()`) affects `profile_exists` — ensure a merged guest with a complete profile is treated as complete.

## Still to verify before/while coding
- Where the **post-login/post-verify redirect** is decided (login success handler, `lib/redirect.ts`, `buildAuthHref`) so incomplete→`/onboarding` vs complete→`/command` is enforced at the right layer (login flow and/or an onboarding-page guard that bounces already-complete users to `/command`).
- Whether any middleware or layout also gates these routes.
- Confirm `submitOnboarding` persistence makes `profile_exists` true on next `getProfile()` (so refresh/return skips onboarding).

## Implementation plan (one focused PR)
1. `next.config`: remove ONLY the `/onboarding` redirect line.
2. New `apps/web/app/_atelier/atelier-onboarding.css` (scoped `.atelier`) OR reuse `atl-doc` + a small onboarding CSS: stepper, dropzone, parsed-CV plate, fields, primary/skip actions, states — paper/ink/sun-red.
3. Rewrite `apps/web/app/onboarding/page.tsx` to the Atelier island, **preserving all behavior** in evidence #4; swap the 3 `/dashboard?skip=1` → `/command`; completion + skip → `/command`.
4. Add an already-complete guard: on mount, if `getProfile().profile_exists` → `router.replace('/command')` (so completed users aren't forced through onboarding). Confirm this matches how login routes users too.
5. Ensure the incomplete→`/onboarding` / complete→`/command` decision is enforced in the login/verify success path (wherever the post-auth redirect lives).
6. EN/AR + RTL via `useLanguage`; keep translation keys (`onboarding*`) — add Atelier ones as needed.

## Required tests (from owner)
- unauth user cannot access onboarding (redirect to signup/login)
- authed **incomplete** user reaches onboarding
- authed **completed** user reaches `/command` (not forced through onboarding)
- verification-required signup journey reaches onboarding after login
- valid CV upload; non-CV rejection; upload failure
- profile submit success; **submit failure does NOT show success**
- refresh preserves persisted completion behavior
- completion and skip route correctly (both → `/command`; skip does not claim completion)
- EN/AR, RTL, desktop, mobile, keyboard, no overflow, no console errors

Test infra: Vitest (`apps/web`, currently 320 passing), Playwright (chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`; **cannot reach ricohunt.com from container** — smoke prod via `curl` cache-busted `?cb=$ts`). Gates: `npm run build` + `npx vitest run` must be green.

## Delivery (owner instructions)
One focused Onboarding PR (restoration + Atelier migration) including the tied DEC-20260710-004 + AI_WORKSPACE updates. Draft PR → wait required CI (frontend/pytest/playwright) → merge only when green + no blocking review → sync main → delete branch → verify Vercel production on merge SHA → smoke `/onboarding` + the routing flow. Then continue to Workspace phase.

## Git state at handoff
- Branch `claude/onboarding-restore-atelier` @ `origin/main` (`c43bedc`). **Uncommitted at handoff:** this handoff + the `DEC-20260710-004` entry in `AI_WORKSPACE/DECISIONS.md` (docs only). No onboarding runtime changes yet. Committed + pushed so the next session can resume from origin.
- All prior phase branches deleted; backup deleted; no other open PRs from this work.

### Production verification

| Endpoint | Result |
|----------|--------|
| `GET /health` (backend) | `200` — all job providers configured, not degraded |
| `GET /version` (backend) | `commit: "3cf539841fd47c7aad7458f8c66bd80aa31ee018"` — matches merge SHA |
| `GET /api/v1/onboarding/status` (backend) | `401 Unauthorized` — endpoint live, correctly rejecting unauthenticated |
| `GET https://ricohunt.com` (frontend) | `200` — landing page live |
| `GET /proxy/health` (Vercel proxy) | `200` — proxy pass-through working |
| `GET /proxy/api/v1/onboarding/status` (Vercel proxy) | `401 Unauthorized` — proxy + endpoint live |

### Verification scope

- **PARTIAL** — backend liveness, SHA match, endpoint availability, frontend reachability, and proxy pass-through all verified via unauthenticated HTTP. Authenticated browser scenarios (login → onboarding routing, CV upload, skip, submit) were not executed from this environment.

### Review summary

- Independent read-only review of `ccf74a0` confirmed: VERIFIED, no blockers, READY
- `get_onboarding_state_readonly` is truly read-only (no DDL/DML/commit)
- DB unavailable / query failure raises `OnboardingStateUnavailable` → sanitized 503
- No failure falls through to `derived_legacy`
- Connections always close
- Login routes on `complete` (not `profile_exists`); no redirect loop
- Skip routes to `/command` without marking completion
- PR scope is onboarding-only (15 files, no unrelated changes)
