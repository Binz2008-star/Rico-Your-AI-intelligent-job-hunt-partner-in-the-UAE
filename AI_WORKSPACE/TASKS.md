### TASK-20260723-003 — #1072: invalidate stale JWTs after reset, deactivation, or role change

Status: review (re-cut from current main per CTO ruling 2026-07-23 on #1138;
originally drafted 2026-07-17 as TASK-20260717-002 — renumbered to avoid the
ID collision with main's Job Result Integrity Gate entry)
Owner: Claude (WRITER; Coder pass, owner-directed "full ownership" of the
2026-07-17 reconciliation-audit remediation sequence)
Branch: `fix/1072-jwt-auth-version`
Issue/PR: #1072

#### Objective

Make issued JWTs revocable: password reset and "log out all devices" bump a
per-user auth_version that every authenticated request validates; deactivated
or deleted accounts reject existing tokens immediately; authorization role
comes from the DB, not stale token claims; store outage fails closed.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `src/api/auth.py`, `src/api/deps.py`,
  `src/repositories/users_repo.py`, `migrations/045_add_auth_version.sql`,
  `scripts/check_migration_drift.py`
- Existing behavior: tokens were stateless for the full 24h TTL; reset,
  deactivation, and role downgrade left already-issued tokens fully valid.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: guest/public identity (#1070), rate limits, cookie semantics.
- Migration 045 is additive, idempotent, MANUAL-APPLY before deploy.
- Per-device logout keeps its existing semantics (cookie delete only).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Password reset invalidates all earlier tokens (atomic with the UPDATE)
- [x] Deactivation/deletion rejects an existing token immediately
- [x] Role downgrade rejects an earlier admin token on admin endpoints
- [x] Store outage → 503 fail-closed, never authorize from stale claims
- [x] Legacy tokens (no `av`) = version 1 → deploy logs nobody out
- [x] logout vs logout-all have distinct, tested semantics
- [x] Env-fallback admin isolated; rejected in production without override

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `tests/test_1072_jwt_auth_version.py` — 27 passed
- [x] Regression: full local unit suite — only new failure vs clean-main
      baseline was the drift-guard (fixed by registering 045); 7200+ passed
- [ ] Frontend build: n/a (logout-all UI is follow-up)
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke: apply 045, then login + /me + logout-all

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260723-003
- GitHub issue/PR: #1072; draft PR from `fix/1072-jwt-auth-version`
- Branch: `fix/1072-jwt-auth-version`
- Base branch: main
- Re-cut: 2026-07-23 onto current main (CTO ruling on #1138). Verified live:
  `public.users.auth_version` absent, users table 72 rows, migration number
  045 unused in main. Manual-apply / no startup auto-apply retained.
- Last safe commit SHA: base is current origin/main at re-cut
- Current head SHA: see branch head on origin
- Uncommitted changes present: no (updated at push time)
- Status: review
- Files inspected: `src/api/auth.py`, `src/api/deps.py`,
  `src/repositories/users_repo.py`, `src/db.py` (availability semantics),
  `src/api/app.py` (hydrate_request_auth_context middleware — added to main
  since the original cut), `src/api/routers/user.py` (`/me`),
  `tests/test_jwt_user_isolation.py` (harness patterns)
- Files changed: `migrations/045_add_auth_version.sql` — additive column;
  `src/repositories/users_repo.py` — AuthStoreUnavailable, get_auth_snapshot,
  increment_auth_version, atomic update_password; `src/api/deps.py` —
  validation core (av match, active check, DB-authoritative role,
  fail-closed 503) + re-cut hardening: the enforcement point now caches on a
  dedicated `request.state.verified_user` and NO LONGER trusts the middleware's
  claims-only `current_user`/`user_id` hydration (that cache would have
  bypassed revocation for real HTTP traffic); `src/api/routers/user.py` —
  `/me` now fully verifies (revoked/deactivated token → guest shape; outage →
  503) instead of echoing claims-only hydration; `src/api/auth.py` — av claim
  at login, env-admin marker, POST /auth/logout-all;
  `scripts/check_migration_drift.py` — 045 drift check;
  `tests/test_1072_jwt_auth_version.py` — suite extended: middleware-bypass
  guards + `/me` revocation guards; `tests/conftest.py` — default healthy fake
  auth store (echoes each token's role) so the whole suite exercises the new
  enforcement without a real DB; `.github/workflows/qa-tests.yml` — suite wired
- Files intentionally not touched: frontend (logout-all button is follow-up
  UI work); refresh-token architecture (issue lists it as optional); the
  claims-only middleware itself (kept for cheap guest/anon hints — the fix is
  that protected deps re-verify, not that the hint is removed)
- What is complete: revocation model, fail-closed validation, middleware-bypass
  hardening, tests
- What is incomplete: UI for logout-all; optional short-TTL+refresh design
- Known blockers: migration 045 must be applied to Neon BEFORE deploy
  (code degrades loudly-but-safely if not, revocation inert); a KNOWN
  pre-existing main failure `tests/unit/test_subscription_feature_gating.py::
  test_limit_message_has_no_doubled_limit_word` (stale 50/50 vs free limit 10)
  is being fixed on a separate branch (`fix/subscription-gate-test-current-limit`)
  — NOT caused by and NOT in scope for this PR
- Validation already run: full curated qa-tests pytest list locally — every
  test green except the one pre-existing unrelated subscription-gate failure
  above; auth suites (test_1072, test_jwt_user_isolation, test_security_audit,
  test_agent) all green with the bypass closed
- Validation still required: exact-head CI on the PR; owner-approved 045 apply
- Deployment/CI/Neon/Vercel state to check next: QA Tests on the PR head
- Next exact action: owner review; then the change-window (Neon restore-point
  branch → apply 045 → schema verify → merge → deploy → auth smoke)
- Stop condition: any test or review finding that validation adds >1 DB
  round-trip per request or breaks guest flows → redesign before merging
- Rollback plan: revert the squash commit (behavior returns to stateless
  tokens); column 045 is additive and harmless to leave; dropping it is a
  separate owner-approved migration


### TASK-20260720-001 — hotfix #1225: agentic_ui option buttons as plain dict (stream TypeError) — PRODUCTION VERIFIED

Status: done — **MERGED (#1225, squash `4ecb5d80`) + PRODUCTION VERIFIED — PASS; incident closed (owner ruling 2026-07-20)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner order 2026-07-20 "افتح فرع hotfix واحدًا من أحدث main… نفّذ الإصلاح الأدنى فقط")
Branch: hotfix/option-buttons-plain-dict (head `9276e79e`, cut from `55e68ad5` = main at cut)
Issue/PR: #1225

#### Objective

Close the production `chat_stream_error err=TypeError` (2026-07-19 23:21:03Z /
23:21:28Z): `_inject_option_buttons` attached a raw `RicoAgenticUi` Pydantic
model to `result["agentic_ui"]`; the `/chat/stream` non-conversational
fallback serializes the done event with bare `json.dumps`, which cannot encode
Pydantic models — every letter-choice response over the stream crashed (e.g.
the ambiguous profile-match clarification for a multi-family seven-role
profile answering "find matching jobs"). The JSON `/chat` path masked the
defect (`RicoChatResponse.agentic_ui` accepts the model instance). Latent
since `224e3ead` (2026-06-20, audit 1-A); #1216 / #1200 / #1205 empirically
ruled out — identical repro at each PR's parent.

#### Scope delivered

- `src/rico_chat_api.py` — single return site in `_inject_option_buttons`:
  `updated_ui.model_dump(exclude_none=True)` (both action enums are `str`
  subclasses, so the dumped dict is `json.dumps`-safe end-to-end).
- `tests/unit/test_option_buttons_serialization.py` — new, 7 pins: seven-role
  profile-match clarification serializes exactly as the SSE done event does;
  `agentic_ui` is a dict, never a model; four `chat_continue` buttons with
  `payload.message`; "Risk & Compliance Officer" unsplit; intent stays
  `job_search_profile_match`; existing-model-input merge stays serializable;
  REST contract `RicoChatResponse(**result)` unregressed.
- `tests/unit/test_option_action_buttons.py` — existing audit 1-A pins
  adapted from model-attribute access to the plain-dict wire contract.

#### Explicitly NOT in scope (owner order)

No `jsonable_encoder` in the router; no fix for the `existing_ui`-as-dict
merge branch (see TASK-20260720-002); no `learning_repo` change (see
TASK-20260720-003); no routing/fallback/provider/timeout change.

#### Rollback

Revert the squash commit — stream path resumes throwing on letter-choice
responses; JSON path unaffected; no data/schema/API-shape effects.

#### Acceptance criteria / verification chain

- [x] Exact-head gates on `9276e79e`: QA Tests success (run 29709215575),
      Workflow Security Guards success (run 29709215581), mergeable clean,
      0 review threads, base == main-at-cut (`55e68ad5`).
- [x] Local: new suite 7/7; tests/unit 3411 passed; neighboring
      chat/profile-match suites 80 passed; exact QA invocation with CI env
      4259 passed / 1 xfailed.
- [x] Owner squash merge as-is (no added commits) → `4ecb5d80`.
- [x] Deploy: "Deploy Render Backend" run #416 (29709499067) success
      00:29:09Z; live `/version` returned `commit=4ecb5d80…5250`,
      `started_at=2026-07-20T00:28:54Z` (owner browser evidence;
      `deployed_at` field is stale by design — not relied on).
- [x] Production smoke (owner browser, one attempt, 2026-07-20): multi-family
      account, literal "find matching jobs" → A/B/C/D options rendered, no
      "Something went wrong", stream uninterrupted, compound role intact.
      Owner verdict: **#1225 Production Verified — PASS; stream incident
      closed.**

### TASK-20260720-002 — /command option-surface duplication + `existing_ui` dict-merge branch (follow-up, not urgent)

Status: proposed — owner-gated ("متابعة مستقلة، غير عاجلة", owner ruling 2026-07-20)
Owner: unassigned (needs owner gate to start)
Branch: —
Issue/PR: —

#### Objective

The #1225 production smoke surfaced a visual duplication on /command: the
clarification renders the role list twice — one row of plain role chips (from
`options[]`) and a second row repeating the first four as mirrored `A)`–`D)`
`agentic_ui` buttons. Related latent defect in the same helper: when
`result["agentic_ui"]` is already a plain dict (the composer's output), the
`else` branch of `_inject_option_buttons` replaces it, dropping pre-existing
actions instead of merging. Neither re-triggers the stream incident. Fix must
be one presentation contract (single option surface) + a merge branch for
dict-shaped `existing_ui`, with pins; global, user-agnostic.

### TASK-20260720-003 — learning_repo `_db_load_profile` json.loads on already-decoded JSONB (separate log, not urgent)

Status: proposed — logged separately per owner order during the 2026-07-19
TypeError investigation ("لا تلمس عيب learning_repo في هذا التحقيق؛ سجّله منفصلًا فقط")
Owner: unassigned (needs owner gate to start)
Branch: —
Issue/PR: —

#### Objective

`src/repositories/learning_repo.py` (`_db_load_profile`, ~357-359) calls
`json.loads` on a value the driver already decoded to a dict (JSONB column),
producing the logged json error seen alongside the 2026-07-19 23:21Z window.
Fix is a type-aware load (accept dict as-is, parse only str) + a pin; verify
no caller depends on the current failure path. Untouched by #1225 by design.

### TASK-20260719-020 — Canonical Career Context and Active-CV Provenance (M1, read-side)

Status: review
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner order 2026-07-19 "Open one Draft PR only: Canonical Career Context and Active-CV Provenance")
Branch: rico/canonical-career-context
Issue/PR: #1205 (Draft)

#### Objective

One legal READ-side resolver (`src/services/career_context.py`) for
active-CV provenance, years-of-experience provenance, and identity-name
validity, consulted by BOTH the profile report context
(`_build_openai_context`) and the job search
(`_target_role_search_response`), so the two surfaces can never diverge
again. On a profile-vs-primary-CV years conflict the absolute figure is
omitted and provenance is exposed; null CV extraction never replaces a
known profile value; job-title-like identity names are flagged, never
displayed.

#### Context

- Program doc: `AI_WORKSPACE/CAREER_CONTEXT_PROGRAM.md` (Vision → Epic →
  Milestone → Phase → PR → Task, full reader/writer map, and the proof
  that years/name have no canonical source: five duplicate `rico_users`
  rows + `get_user_bundle` rule-5 `updated_at DESC` floating + email-
  scoped `user_documents` vs row-scoped `rico_profiles`).
- Relevant files: `src/services/career_context.py` (new),
  `src/rico_chat_api.py:2469` and `:6053` (wire points, fail-soft),
  `src/services/document_resolver.py` (existing CV precedence, reused),
  `src/rico_db.py` (primary-slot atomicity — already correct, untouched).

#### Constraints

- READ-ONLY: no writes, no schema changes, no migrations, no production
  data mutation. Duplicate-row merge is M2, owner-gated, separate PR.
- Do not touch: context follow-up, chat sessions, analytics, retention,
  ranking, locale, #1177.
- Keep Draft. No auto-merge. Owner review required.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Owner-required test categories in
      `tests/unit/test_career_context.py` (10-vs-8 conflict, null
      extraction, primary switching, conflicting primary flags,
      report/search resolver parity, job-title-like name rejection,
      user-confirmed professional-term name, cross-user scope,
      duplicate same-email identity rows → explicit ambiguity + no
      leakage, resolver-exception SAFE degradation) — 17 tests pass.
- [x] Fail SAFE, not fail soft (owner gate 1): resolver failure withholds
      absolute years and unverified name with neutral copy + sanitized
      diagnostic — never falls back to the legacy read.
- [x] Ownership boundary (owner gate 2): `rico_db.count_identity_rows`
      (read-only, same predicate as `get_user_bundle`) →
      `ambiguous_identity` state; profile figures displayable only when
      CV-corroborated under ambiguity; unconfirmed names untrusted.
- [x] Architecture claim corrected (owner gate 3): `is_primary` =
      active-document selector, NOT identity source; M1 read-path
      mitigation / M2 duplicate rows / M3 writer hardening.
- [x] Full `tests/unit/` suite: 3300 passed, 0 failed;
      `tests/test_rico_routes.py` 145 passed (baseline).
- [x] `py_compile` clean on touched files.
- [ ] Wait for #1194 to settle, rebase onto exact latest main, TASKS.md
      resolved with main canonical (owner gate 5).
- [ ] Exact-head CI green + full state report with READY/HOLD verdict
      (owner gate 6).
- [ ] Owner review (merge gate). Keep Draft — no auto-merge.

  resolver failure degrades to neutral copy (years/name withheld); full
  legacy behavior returns only via the git revert itself

### TASK-20260719-019 — fix/sse-done-tolerant-parse: SSE done payloads through the tolerant chat schema (JSON↔SSE parity)

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1210, squash `b656c79c`)**; CI 9/9 green on
head `d8307c36`; frontend-only, Vercel production deploy auto-fires;
production stream smoke rides the owner's next pass
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner full-execution authorization 2026-07-19 "do it")
Branch: fix/sse-done-tolerant-parse
Issue/PR: #1210 (merged)

#### Objective

Close the last loose end of the 2026-07-19 16:22Z render-FAIL incident
class: the SSE path yielded the `done` event's structured payload as a raw
cast (`JSON.parse(raw) as ChatStreamEvent`), bypassing the tolerant
`RicoChatResponseSchema` that guards the JSON path (#1191/#1193) — the two
paths could disagree on the same payload. `normalizeStreamDoneEvent`
(exported for tests) now normalizes every `done` payload through the same
schema; if even the tolerant parse fails, only the structured payload is
dropped (streamed text still renders; a tokenless stream already falls back
to the validated JSON endpoint). `token`/`error` events pass through by
identity. Global and user-agnostic: authenticated + public streams, EN/AR,
all providers.

#### Required verification

- [x] New suite `chat-stream-tolerance.test.ts` 5/5; existing
      `chat-response-tolerance` 8/8.
- [x] Full vitest 78 files / 821 passed; `npm run build` exit code 0
      (unfiltered).
- [x] CI 9/9 green on head; Vercel preview Ready; merged as squash
      `b656c79c` (2026-07-19).
- [ ] Post-deploy stream smoke rides the owner's next production pass.

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260719-019
- GitHub issue/PR: #1210 (merged)
- Branch: fix/sse-done-tolerant-parse
- Base branch: main
- Last safe commit SHA: c76165d2 (origin/main at cut)

- What is complete: implementation + 5 parity pins + full local suite/build
  - CI 9/9 + merged as squash `b656c79c` (2026-07-19)
- Validation still required: production stream smoke (owner's next pass)

- Stop condition: n/a (merged)

### TASK-20260719-018 — Hotfix: threaded chat persistence loses the active session (contextvars copy)

Status: review
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner branch authorization "نعم", 2026-07-19)
Branch: fix/chat-session-thread-stamping
Issue/PR: (draft PR from this branch)

#### Objective

Fix the defect caught by the owner-ordered 38bf14a production-verification
smoke: `RicoChatAPI._append_chat` dispatches the DB write to a daemon
`threading.Thread`, and a bare thread starts with an EMPTY contextvars
context — so the ambient active chat session (#1197) read None and every
turn was stamped into the default thread in the real uvicorn runtime.
TestClient-based tests never crossed the thread boundary, which is why CI
was green. Fix: run the worker inside `contextvars.copy_context()`.

The smoke-test flow exposed the bug, but the fix is global — it affects
every authenticated user's threaded writes on every runtime.

#### Evidence

- Local full-stack smoke on the byte-identical 38bf14a backend (real
  PostgreSQL 16 + uvicorn + HTTP, two synthetic users): 15 failures before
  the fix (all thread writes landed in default), **26/26 green after** —
  A/B isolation, SSE mid-flight cancel pinned to the right thread,
  cross-user denial, scoped delete, legacy access, zero empty/dup rows.
- Production Neon (read-only): migration 048 objects present exactly once;
  0 threaded rows existed at verification time, so no production data needs
  repair — writes simply stayed in the default thread until this fix.

#### Scope

- `src/rico_chat_api.py` — `_append_chat` dispatch runs in a copied
  context (comment documents the failure mode).
- `tests/unit/test_chat_sessions.py` — regression test pinning that the
  background worker observes the active session.
- No schema, route, or frontend change.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Regression test fails on the bare-Thread dispatch, passes with
      copy_context.
- [x] tests/unit/test_chat_sessions.py 17 passed; tests/test_rico_routes.py
      145 passed; chat-history persistence suites green.
- [ ] CI green on head; owner merge ruling; post-deploy re-verification
      (production smoke re-run) before #1197 is declared PRODUCTION
      VERIFIED.

#### Rollback plan

Revert the squash commit — dispatch returns to the bare thread (writes
fall back to the default thread; no data loss, no schema impact).

### TASK-20260719-017 — WhatsApp-assisted subscription as a secondary channel alongside Paddle

> Renumbered from TASK-20260719-015 during the 2026-07-19 ledger sync on
> PR #1209's branch: two parallel sessions had both claimed -015 (this
> entry via #1207 and the #1200 relevance-floor entry). Content unchanged.

Status: **MERGED (#1207, `932fe9d`) — owner merge order 2026-07-19; migration
049 applied to production and verified (table + both indexes, 0 rows);
channel remains fail-closed until the owner sets
WHATSAPP_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED + WHATSAPP_SUBSCRIPTION_NUMBER on Render**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner directive 2026-07-19 — DEC-20260719-003)
Branch: feat/whatsapp-assisted-subscription (cut from main 38bf14a; merged)
Issue/PR: #1207 (merged)

#### Objective

Restore WhatsApp-assisted subscription as a SECONDARY assisted channel.
Paddle stays the primary automated provider (behavior/plans/prices
untouched; Rico Monthly USD 21.50/month; no Stripe). WhatsApp is an
assisted channel, not a payment processor: creating a request or opening
WhatsApp NEVER grants entitlement — activation only via the existing
admin-only manual mechanism after owner payment verification.

#### Scope delivered

- Migration 049 `whatsapp_subscription_requests` (additive; one pending
  request per user via partial unique index; documented DROP rollback;
  drift-check signatures registered).
- `src/repositories/whatsapp_requests_repo.py` + new router
  `src/api/routers/billing_whatsapp.py`: public `{whatsapp_active}` flag,
  authenticated request endpoint — fail-closed config
  (WHATSAPP_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED + E.164 WHATSAPP_SUBSCRIPTION_NUMBER),
  server-resolved plan/price/currency, opaque RICO-… reference, sanitized
  wa.me URL (EN/AR templates: reference/plan/price only — no email/JWT/
  ids/CV data).

### TASK-20260719-016 — PR #1197: multi-session chat threads — Sessions rail lists and switches all conversations

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1197, squash `38bf14a5`)**; Render deploy
success on that SHA (deploy-render run 29702750101 gates /version+/health);
issue #1190 closed as resolved; owner production smoke of the rail pending
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner directive 2026-07-19 "بدي كل الجلسات يطلعو بالشريط الجانبي"; owner start ruling "ابدأ")
Branch: claude/sessions-sidebar-9zh6dq
Issue/PR: #1197

#### Objective

Close the documented multi-session backend capability gap (DEC-20260719-002
boundary 5 deferred item) for real: one authenticated user can hold many
parallel chat threads, listed in the /command Sessions rail with switching,
per-thread delete, and truthful live titles. The boundary forbade the
frontend from SIMULATING multi-session history; this PR builds the real
backend capability instead, so nothing is simulated.

#### Freeze-lift record

The `/command` design freeze (DEC-20260719-002) remains active. The owner
message of 2026-07-19 directing "بدي كل الجلسات يطلعو بالشريط الجانبي حتى
اتنقل بينهم اتصرف بحريه كامله" and the subsequent "ابدأ" ruling on the
phase plan are the one-PR-only lift for PR #1197 alone; it expires on
merge/close.

#### Scope delivered

- Migration 048 (+ idempotent startup DDL): nullable `session_id UUID` on
  `rico_chat_history`; legacy rows stay NULL = the "default" thread.
- `src/services/chat_session_context.py`: ambient per-request thread
  context; SSE generator context pinning; session-id validation.
- Session-scoped history/clear + derived `GET /chat/sessions`;
  `session_id` accepted on POST /chat and /chat/stream. Omitted
  session_id everywhere = byte-identical pre-session behavior.
- Rail lists all threads (capability-gated on the sessions endpoint;
  guests and older backends keep the original single-thread surface);
  motion layer per existing vocabulary; EN/AR strings.
- Drift guard registered (scripts/check_migration_drift.py 048).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Backend: 16 unit + 9 route tests (incl. real-SSE context pinning);
      tests/test_rico_routes.py 145 passed.
- [x] Frontend: rail + page tests; full vitest 796 passed; build clean;
      lint at pre-existing baseline.
- [x] CI green on head 85192d5 (QA Tests run 29701608894, success).
- [ ] Owner production smoke after deploy: two threads, switch, delete,
      reload.

- GitHub issue/PR: #1197
- Branch: claude/sessions-sidebar-9zh6dq
- Base branch: main
- Last safe commit SHA: 826c7a3 (origin/main at cut)
- Current head SHA: 85192d5 (+ this ledger entry at push time)
- Status: verified — MERGED (#1197, squash `38bf14a5`, 2026-07-19); Render
  deploy success on that SHA
- What is complete: implementation + tests + CI green + merge + backend
  deploy + issue #1190 closed with evidence
- Validation still required: owner production smoke (two threads, switch,
  delete, reload; migration 048 self-applies via startup DDL; drift job
  verifies)
- Next exact action: Phase 1 (/applications compact stage-tagged rows) as
  its own task/branch/PR, when the owner schedules it
- Rollback plan: revert the squash commit; session_id column is additive
  and ignored by old code — no DB action needed

### TASK-20260719-012 — Live Paddle checkout failure on /subscription: diagnosis + fail-closed repair

Status: **MERGED (#1194, `c76165d`) — deployed; owner live gates 1–10 pending**
Owner: Claude (session 2026-07-19)
Branch: claude/paddle-checkout-subscription-fix-rsxety (merged by owner 2026-07-19 21:06Z; branch deleted)
Issue/PR: #1194 (merged)

> Deploy record (2026-07-19): "Deploy to Production" (Vercel) success and
> "Deploy Render Backend" success on merge commit `c76165d` — both stacks
> serve the fix. Production behavior now: exact Paddle error codes are
> surfaced, and any incomplete/mismatched Paddle env fails CLOSED (disabled
> button) instead of the opaque "Something went wrong" overlay. Remaining:
> owner live gates 1–10 per
> `HANDOFFS/2026-07-19-paddle-live-checkout-repair.md` (env matrix on
> Render+Vercel, Paddle live domain approval, real transaction → webhook →
> single entitlement → cancel/refund → duplicate redelivery).

#### Gate (owner ruling, 2026-07-19)

# 1194 must be rebased clean onto current main (its TASKS entry updates

THIS entry — no duplicate), reviewed, and mergeable before merge.
**Merge is owner-only.** The Paddle LIVE gates 1–10 (real browser
checkout smoke after deployment, per the handoff) remain mandatory
regardless of CI state — billing is never declared production-verified
before all gates pass.

#### Objective

Repair the live "Something went wrong" Paddle overlay failure on
ricohunt.com/subscription without weakening the fail-closed posture.
Root cause (owner screenshots + repo evidence): a client/server Paddle
environment mismatch introduced during the partial live cutover — the
2026-07-17 sandbox smoke passed, Render was switched toward live while
Vercel still carries sandbox-era vars (`/settings` proved the production
bundle has no `NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`) — while the code
(a) discarded Paddle.js v2's top-level `event.error` code, (b) chose
sandbox/production from a standalone flag instead of the authoritative
`test_`/`live_` token prefix, (c) reported `paddle_active: true` without
the full server credential set, and (d) left the /settings upgrade button
fail-open.

#### What changed (per #1194)

- `apps/web/lib/paddle.ts` — surface the exact Paddle error
  `detail [code]` (toast + console); Paddle.js environment derived from
  the client-token prefix (flag is fallback only, contradiction logged);
  `sanitizePaddleErrorDetail` redacts emails + the checkout session token
  from the free-text `detail` before console/toast (type/code preserved
  exactly; pinned by a test embedding both inside `error.detail`).
- `apps/web/lib/billing.ts` — `resolveBillingUiMode` fails closed when
  the client token environment contradicts the backend `sandbox` flag.
- `src/api/routers/paddle_billing.py` — `paddle_active` requires
  BILLING_MODE=paddle AND API key + webhook secret + price ID;
  checkout-session 503s when inactive (rollback is authoritative
  server-side).
- `apps/web/components/billing/PaddleBillingSection.tsx` — /settings
  upgrade gated by the same runtime config; server-resolved price_id.
- Docs: `HANDOFFS/2026-07-19-paddle-live-checkout-repair.md` (diagnosis,
  live env matrix, 10 go-live gates, error-code interpretation); rollback
  section of `paddle_billing_setup_rollback.md` corrected;
  `.env.local.example` token-prefix contract.

#### Required verification

- [x] Backend billing suites green (`test_paddle_billing`,
      `test_billing_mode`, `test_billing_hardening`,
      `test_billing_ops_no_stripe`, `test_paddle_webhook_body_cap`).
- [x] Frontend: billing-mode + paddle-event-callback suites; full vitest;
      `npm run build` verified by exit code.
- [ ] CI green on the rebased head; mergeable against main.
- [ ] Owner review + owner merge.
- [ ] Post-deploy: Paddle LIVE gates 1–10 (owner-run; production access
      required).

### TASK-20260719-011 — fix/command-chat-response-tolerance: complementary fail-open hardening on top of the #1191 contract

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1193, `aaa3cca3`)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner full execution delegation 2026-07-19)
Branch: fix/command-chat-response-tolerance (rebuilt on main 826c7a3 after #1191 merged)
Issue/PR: #1193

#### Reconciliation record

Two writers independently root-caused the 16:22Z production FAIL
(closed `verification_status` enum rejecting `aggregator_untrusted` and
discarding the whole successful reply). **#1191 merged first and its
design is canonical** (KNOWN_VERIFICATION_STATUSES + unknown →
`needs_source_verification`, never promoted). This PR was rebuilt on top
of it, dropping the competing verification_status change, and now carries
ONLY the complementary hardening #1191 did not cover — on main today, a
null `confidence`, a numeric-string `score`, a null top-level
boolean/record, or ANY one malformed match row still rejects the entire
reply into the generic FAIL bubble.

**Ledger correction:** #1191's entry reused the ID `TASK-20260719-008`,
which already belongs to the merged PR #1188 rail goal-mini task — a
collision from the parallel writer; recorded here rather than rewriting
history. Forensic detail of the incident (Neon timeline; #1187 guard
PASSED) lives in this PR's body and the session record.

#### Scope

- `confidence` → tolerant (known tiers pass; null/unknown → undefined).
- `score` → numeric-string coercion; junk → undefined.
- Top-level `success`/`profile_context_present`/`entities`/`tool_args` →
  null-tolerant.
- `matches` → per-row salvage: malformed row dropped with a console
  warning; siblings and the reply survive (backend #887 philosophy).
- Regression pins for the exact production payload + the #1191 contract
  (values preserved; unknown → normalized, never rejected/promoted).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] All pins green (focused suite); full vitest green; `npm run build`
      verified by EXIT CODE with unfiltered output (process lesson from
      the first head: a grep filter masked a CI-visible type error).
- [x] No competing verification_status change — #1191 design untouched.

### TASK-20260719-010 — fix/command-subscription-cta: structured subscription CTA instead of a dead raw-text link

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1192, `6caff77f`)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner defect ruling + one-PR-only /command freeze lift naming `fix/command-subscription-cta`, 2026-07-19)
Branch: fix/command-subscription-cta (cut from main 07e95c3)
Issue/PR: #1192 (squash `6caff77ff132b7997a34f23ba2d45c7fc8df0d7d`)

#### Objective

Production defect (owner smoke, 2026-07-19 ~18:41Z): Rico's Arabic
subscription reply wrote `ricohunt.com/subscription` as plain text — the
markdown renderers don't autolink bare domains, so users saw a dead
string. Fix: (1) a reply that references the subscription surface gets a
real localized CTA ("View plans" / "عرض الباقات") navigating to the
internal `/subscription` route; (2) bare `ricohunt.com/subscription`
mentions are linkified in BOTH markdown renderers to the internal route so
the text is never dead; (3) no plan copy in the CTA — `/subscription`
stays the single source of truth for plans/prices.

#### Freeze-lift record

The `/command` design freeze (DEC-20260719-002) remains active. The owner
message of 2026-07-19 naming `fix/command-subscription-cta` and directing
"نسجل هذا كعيب منفصل ونصلحه قبل أي تحسين تصميم جديد في /command" is the
one-PR-only lift for THIS PR alone; it expires on merge/close.

#### Constraints

- No billing/backend/price changes; no prompts change (the model's stale
  plan copy in replies is a separate backend-prompt concern, documented,
  out of scope here).
- Detection is conservative (subscription URL/path mentions only — no
  keyword heuristics).
- Internal navigation only; external http(s) links keep new-tab+noopener.
- EN/AR + RTL; works on both authenticated and public surfaces
  (currentColor styling — no scope-variable dependency).
- The FAIL render defect (16:22Z) stays code-frozen pending the owner's
  DevTools capture — nothing in this PR touches response
  validation/parsing/normalization.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] CTA renders under Rico replies that reference the subscription
      surface (not on error bubbles), href `/subscription`, EN/AR labels,
      RTL arrow; carries no plan copy (pinned).
- [x] Bare mention linkified to internal `/subscription` in
      RicoReplyMarkdown AND RicoMarkdownContent (same-tab; pinned);
      existing markdown links untouched; look-alike domains
      (`notricohunt.com`) never match (pinned).
- [x] RicoMarkdownContent still forces new-tab+noopener for external
      links (pinned).
- [x] Focused suite 12/12; full vitest 783/783; `npm run build` clean.

### TASK-20260719-009 — PR-V4-3: /dashboard Ask Rico affordance via existing /command?q= deep-link only

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1189, `e86c6f5`)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner execution mandate 2026-07-19, Command Workspace v4 program)
Branch: claude/rico-workspace-audit-x65z30 (re-cut from main d6a48a3 after #1188)
Issue/PR: #1189 (squash `e86c6f5453ab8b4d54f13dcaf5fe468c44f6cd0e`)

#### Objective

Add an "Ask Rico" affordance to the /dashboard goal panel that deep-links
to /command with the established one-shot `?q=` prompt pattern
(`lib/deepLinkPrompt.ts`). Replaces the held embedded-copilot direction
(owner ruling): no panel, no second chat surface, no second chat runtime,
no new API surface — a link that opens the existing conversation with a
localized, single-topic, guidance-only prompt (no execution claim; the

# 1002 "Discuss with Rico" honesty precedent)

#### Constraints

- Existing routing only; `/command` behavior untouched (freeze respected —
  the route already consumes `?q=` in production).
- Bilingual prompt; claims no execution or success.
- One affordance; no scope growth.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Link renders in the goal panel (ready state only) with
      `href=/command?q=<encoded localized prompt>`; EN and AR pinned;
      absent in the error state (pinned).
- [x] The PR-V4-1 scope guard (no `?q=` on suggested-next cards) still
      passes — the affordance is a distinct element.
- [x] Focused suite 18/18; full vitest 754/754; build clean.

### TASK-20260719-008 — PR-V4-2a (+folded 2b): WorkspaceShell rail goal-mini + applications nav count (fail-hidden, single cached fetch)

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1188, `d6a48a3`)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner execution mandate 2026-07-19, Command Workspace v4 program)
Branch: claude/rico-workspace-audit-x65z30 (re-cut from main b262032 after #1186)
Issue/PR: #1188 (squash `d6a48a351f1ef5098100c0f480413447a214d3b9`)

#### Objective

Add the frozen v4 reference's goal-mini card to the shared WorkspaceShell
rail (desktop sidebar + mobile drawer) and an applications count chip on
the Applications nav item — both from ONE cached read of the existing
`GET /api/v1/mission/current`, strictly fail-hidden (loading/error/disabled
render nothing; shell byte-identical to before).

#### PR-V4-2b fold-in evidence (owner condition)

`MissionState.applications_sent` already carries the applications count, so
the nav chip rides the SAME single cached fetch as the goal-mini:

- no duplicate fetching — module-level 60s cache + in-flight promise dedupe
  (pinned by test: consecutive shell mounts = 1 request);
- no weak caching — TTL cache shared across all shell consumers;
- no blocking shell paint — chrome renders immediately, data fills in
  fail-hidden;
- no unnecessary shared-route cost — app-variant shells (/command,
  public-capable) and /dashboard (goal panel already shows the data)
  never fetch at all (pinned by tests).
Per the owner ruling, 2b therefore folds into 2a.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: backend, `/command` behavior/content (app variant renders
  no new chrome and fires no request — freeze respected), routing, tokens.
- Fail-hidden is a hard contract: any failure — including synchronous
  throws — renders today's shell unchanged.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Goal-mini renders only from loaded mission data: derived bilingual
      title (structured fields; English-only server string never
      rendered), progress bar, /dashboard link; mobile drawer closes on
      navigate.
- [x] Fail-hidden pinned: fetch failure → no card, no chip, nav intact.
- [x] No fetch on /dashboard; no fetch and no card in the app variant.
- [x] Count chip only when applications_sent > 0, same single fetch.
- [x] rail-goal-mini suite 8/8; full vitest 751/751; `npm run build` clean.

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `rail-goal-mini.test.tsx` 8 passed; full vitest 751/751
- [x] Frontend build: clean
- [ ] CI green on the PR head

- What is incomplete: CI on the PR head
- Known blockers: none

  Regression note: the first full run failed 57 tests (existing suites
  partially mock `@/lib/api` without `getMission`); fixed by honoring the
  fail-hidden contract for synchronous throws in the hook — no unrelated
  test files were modified.
- Validation still required: CI on head

### TASK-20260719-015 — Relevance floor: cross-family single-token fix (Bybit/HSE case)

Status: review
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner full-ownership mandate 2026-07-19 evening — track ordered after the verification_status hotfix)
Branch: rico/relevance-floor-cross-family
Issue/PR: #1200

#### Objective

Stop cross-family single words from satisfying the explicit-title relevance
floor. Production evidence (twice on 2026-07-19, 13:26Z and 16:22Z smokes):
a search for "HSE Manager" surfaced "Head of Trading Risk" at Bybit as its
only confident "match" — the taxonomy family expansion contributes "risk",
and one single-token title hit cleared the floor. In the 16:22Z incident the
integrity gate honestly filtered 21 off-title results and the lone survivor
was the irrelevant one.

#### Scope delivered

- Shared 3-layer evidence rule in `src/job_integrity.py`
  (`role_text_supported`): phrase substring (incl. taxonomy alias phrases
  — "safety manager" → HSE Manager) OR one STRONG token OR >= 2 distinct
  WEAK tokens. The strong/weak split is data-derived per term from
  `cross_family_term_counts()` (role_classifier, additive): a family term
  mentioned by >= 3 distinct families (audit=6, compliance=5,
  environment=5, risk=3) is WEAK cross-domain vocabulary; concentrated
  terms (sustainability=2, inspection=2, quality=1) stay STRONG — so an
  ESG search still reaches "Sustainability Manager" while an HSE search
  never reaches "Head of Trading Risk".
- The strict rule applies at the DISPLAY FLOOR only; the integrity gate
  keeps its legacy single-hit vocabulary (strong ∪ weak) so off-title
  live listings are dropped by the floor with the honest "didn't strongly
  match — broaden?" reply, never mislabeled as "couldn't retrieve".
  (filter_listings gained optional 3-tuple support, tested, unused by the
  pipeline for now.)
- `_requested_domain_terms` returns (strong, weak, phrases);
  `role_alias_phrases()` + `cross_family_term_counts()` added
  (additive). No per-role/per-account hardcoding.
- Tests: 14 new regression pins incl. the exact production case, ESG→
  Sustainability preserved, cross-domain collisions, AR/degenerate inputs,
  integrity 3-tuple + legacy modes; the pre-existing
  test_search_title_relevance_floor suite passes except one test that
  fails identically on pristine main in this container (env artifact).

#### Verification

- Full-tree failure set on this branch matches the pristine-main baseline
  (30 pre-existing container artifacts; zero new) — evidence in PR body.
- Post-merge product gate: repeat an HSE Manager production search — the
  Bybit-class result must be absent (honest empty/broaden reply instead).

Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner hotfix authorization 2026-07-19 post-#1187 smoke)
Branch: fix/chat-verification-status-contract
Issue/PR: #1191

#### Objective

Align `JobMatchSchema.verification_status` with the backend's CURRENT emit
vocabulary so a valid REST-fallback chat response is never discarded
wholesale. Root cause (2026-07-19 16:22Z production smoke): the stale
2-value enum (`live | lead_needs_verification`) rejected
`aggregator_untrusted`, `validateShape` threw
"Invalid authenticated Rico chat response" (lib/api.ts:89), and the user
saw a generic error although the server had run exactly one cascade and
stored the full reply. Reproduced deterministically with the stored
production payload.

#### Scope delivered

- `apps/web/lib/schemas/index.ts` only: `KNOWN_VERIFICATION_STATUSES`
  (owner-required five: live_verified / login_required / rate_limited /
  aggregator_untrusted / needs_source_verification, plus still-emitted
  google_intermediary / expired / live / lead_needs_verification —
  file:line evidence in the PR body) + forward-compat normalization:
  unknown value → `needs_source_verification` with console warning —
  never promoted to a trusted status, never dropping the response.
- 6 acceptance tests (`chat-verification-status-contract.test.ts`)
  incl. the sanitized production payload shape and the REST-fallback
  visibility pin (sendChat resolves; matches + message intact).
- NOT in scope (owner order): backend/source-quality logic, SSE path,
  #1187 operation ownership, relevance-floor (separate track).

#### Verification

- Full frontend suite 777 passed; build green.
- Post-deploy gate (owner): repeat the REST-fallback smoke — the reply
  must render instead of the generic error.

### TASK-20260719-007 — PR-V4-1: /dashboard Overview goal panel + suggested next actions (real MissionState only)

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1186, `b262032e`)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner execution mandate 2026-07-19, Command Workspace v4 program)
Branch: claude/rico-workspace-audit-x65z30 (re-cut from main fb21bda after #1185)
Issue/PR: #1186 (squash `b262032e97fa6fa4f2c95a09a91c46a7a7d4f52c`)

#### Objective

Evolve `DashboardAtelier` toward the frozen v4 reference's Overview goal
panel + "Suggested next" block using ONLY real `MissionState` data
(`GET /api/v1/mission/current`): localized goal title derived from the
structured `target_roles`/`target_locations` fields, milestone pills from
the server's `missing_factors` tokens, and max-3 suggested next actions
derived from the same tokens + real stats, each linking to an existing
route. Activity timeline stays omitted (no data source).

#### Context

- Relevant files: `apps/web/components/workspace/DashboardAtelier.tsx`,
  new `apps/web/__tests__/dashboard-atelier.test.tsx`.
- Relevant docs: DEC-20260719-002 (boundaries),
  `design-handoffs/reviewed/2026-07-19-command-workspace-v4/README.md`.
- Existing behavior: mission progress + checklist + stat plates + static
  quick actions; `/onboarding` redirect in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  (untouched); backend `goal`/`next_recommendation` strings are
  English-only, so bilingual presentation derives client-side from the
  structured fields and stable `missing_factors` tokens
  (`cv_uploaded`/`roles_set`/`locations_set`/`pipeline_active`).

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: backend, `/command`, shell chrome, routing, other routes.
- Real data only; no fake states; EN/AR + RTL; production tokens via
  `useWorkspaceTheme()`.
- `?q=` Ask Rico deep-links are PR-V4-3 scope — this PR uses plain route
  links only.

#### Intentional decisions (documented deviations)

- Static "Quick actions" grid replaced by the derived "Suggested next"
  block (max 3) — same destinations remain reachable from the sidebar nav.
- English-only `mission.goal`/`next_recommendation`/`blocking_reason`
  strings are not rendered; localized equivalents derive from structured
  fields/tokens (same server truth, bilingual presentation).
- Stat-plate label "In pipeline" → "Applications" (plain-language
  terminology rule from #1157; adjacent copy was already being edited).
- Error state becomes explicit (message + Retry) instead of rendering
  zeroed panels — zeros on failure were untruthful data.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Goal panel: localized title from role/city fields; empty mission
      falls back to the existing "Set your first mission" copy; progress
      bar has progressbar ARIA; milestone pills mirror the 4 server
      factors; "Edit goal" links to `/profile?section=goals` (real link).
- [x] Suggested next: pure exported derivation, priority = server
      `missing_factors` order, deduped, capped at 3, never empty; all
      hrefs are existing routes (pinned: no `?q=` links — PR-V4-3 scope).
- [x] Explicit loading / error(+retry) / empty handling; EN + AR.
- [x] Tests green (dashboard-atelier suite 15/15; full vitest 743/743);
      `npm run build` clean.

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `dashboard-atelier.test.tsx` 15 passed; full vitest
      71 files / 743 passed
- [x] Frontend build: `npm run build` clean
- [ ] CI green on the PR head

### TASK-20260719-006 — Governance: adopt the frozen Command Workspace v4 design reference + boundaries (docs-only)

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1185, `fb21bda`)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner rulings 2026-07-19)
Branch: claude/rico-workspace-audit-x65z30
Issue/PR: #1185 (squash `fb21bda0950b2f867132ebf83131dac72bcd72bb`)

#### Objective

Record the owner-approved `Rico Command Workspace v4.dc.html` as a frozen
design reference with binding boundaries — one reviewed handoff, one decision
record (DEC-20260719-002), and this single governance task. Docs-only. This
task does NOT authorize implementation work, and no implementation tasks are
created in advance: each future implementation PR creates its own task entry
at cut time, under its own owner approval.

#### Context

- Relevant files:
  `design-handoffs/reviewed/2026-07-19-command-workspace-v4/README.md` (new),
  `AI_WORKSPACE/DECISIONS.md` (DEC-20260719-002), this ledger entry.
- Relevant docs: `AI_WORKSPACE/ATELIER_FULL_SITE_MIGRATION.md` (program
  inventory + /command freeze authority), DEC-20260717-001, DEC-20260716-001.
- Existing behavior: none changed — zero runtime files in the diff.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: runtime files (`apps/web`, `src`), backend, auth, chat logic,
  database/migrations, billing, Career Memory, production configuration,
  PR #1177.
- Required statements (owner): the reference is frozen/approved; modes map to
  existing routes; production Ctrl/Cmd+K behavior remains unchanged; Memory,
  Interview, Learning, Activity, embedded Copilot, and per-mode transcripts
  remain deferred; the /command design freeze remains active; this PR does
  not authorize any implementation work.
- Keep scope limited to: exactly the three documentation artifacts above.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Reviewed handoff records provenance, acceptance contracts, known
      limitations, boundaries, and the not-canonical list; raw HTML stays
      uncommitted (obsidian-v4 precedent).
- [x] One decision record (DEC-20260719-002) with the required statements.
- [x] Exactly one governance task (this entry); no implementation tasks
      pre-created.
- [x] No runtime file changes; no deploy-relevant diff.

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: n/a — docs-only, no runtime surface.
- [x] Frontend build: n/a — no frontend files touched.
- [ ] CI green on the PR head (docs-only jobs).
- [x] Local smoke: n/a.

- Files changed:

  reviewed handoff; `AI_WORKSPACE/DECISIONS.md` — DEC-20260719-002;
  `AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md` — this governance task
- What is complete: audit, owner rulings, the three artifacts
- What is incomplete: nothing within this task's scope
- Known blockers: none
- Validation already run: repo-verified next free IDs (TASK-20260719-006,
  DEC-20260719-002); working tree clean at cut; branch anchored on

- Validation still required: CI on the PR head
- Next exact action: open Draft PR; verify CI; merge on green (owner
  execution mandate 2026-07-19); then re-anchor for the next approved PR
- Stop condition: any reviewer/CI finding that the diff exceeds the three
  documentation artifacts
- Rollback plan: revert the single squash commit — removes the handoff and
  both ledger entries; nothing else is affected

### TASK-20260718-022 — PR #1171: mobile usability pass on /command + /profile

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed**
Owner: Claude (production-defect remediation, owner directive 2026-07-18)
Branch: `fix/mobile-usability-command-profile` (merged, auto-deleted)
Issue/PR: #1171 (squash `96464b8e101b5a034470b07f359aaebc079a7d6d`)

#### Delivered

- CTRL+K/CTRL+J hint lines hidden below `md` on both chat audiences (desktop
  keeps them + WCAG contrast check); composer proven in-viewport at
  320/360/390 with no fixed-nav overlap; `/profile` unsaved bar compacted
  (Save/Discard on-screen at 320px); warning text `break-words` (zero
  horizontal overflow EN + AR RTL). New `e2e/mobile-usability.spec.ts`
  (10 checks); stability spec re-anchored; `apps/web/e2e/screenshots/`
  gitignored (evidence artifacts never committed). 22/22 focused e2e.

### TASK-20260718-021 — PR #1170: single approved shell on authenticated workspace routes (P0)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed ("Deploy to Production" success)**
Owner: Claude (production-defect remediation, owner directive 2026-07-18)
Branch: `fix/single-shell-authenticated-command` (merged, auto-deleted)
Issue/PR: #1170 (squash `e2ba730b497ba07687c53dba5e044194b89e60fa`)

#### Root cause (owner production screenshots)

- Legacy dark MobileCommandHeader + MobileBottomNav still mounted for the
  authenticated audience on `/command` mobile — the #1145 compromise
  (`WorkspaceShell variant="app"` rendered no mobile chrome, so the page kept
  the legacy pair) layered old chrome over the Atelier workspace.

#### Delivered

- WorkspaceShell app variant: opt-in `mobileChrome` (shared mobile bar +
  drawer, single navigation owner) + `mobileExtras` slot; authenticated
  `/command` uses it — New chat / Clear chat / Log out live in the drawer;
  MobileCommandHeader is public/checking-only; MobileBottomNav mount deleted;
  composer 56px dock compensation removed (safe-area kept). `/profile`
  `/settings` `/applications` verified already single-shell and pinned.
  Proof: `e2e/single-shell.spec.ts` + updated stability spec (12 checks,
  real Chromium; AR RTL; public surface unchanged); screenshots delivered
  as artifacts.

### TASK-20260718-020 — PR #1169: restore live profile saves (P0 production outage)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed ("Deploy to Production" success)**
Owner: Claude (production-defect remediation, owner directive 2026-07-18)
Branch: `fix/profile-save-wrapper-clear-fields` (merged, auto-deleted)
Issue/PR: #1169 (squash `1e8615ce1137e725485e2a41d1439bf133abd039`)

#### Root cause (owner production screenshot: "Profile update could not be saved")

- #1166 called the router's stable patch-point wrapper with `clear_fields=`;
  the wrapper's signature didn't accept it → TypeError on EVERY save,
  swallowed by the endpoint's broad except into the generic 503. CI green
  because endpoint tests mock the wrapper symbol itself (over-mocking).

#### Delivered

- Wrapper accepts + forwards `clear_fields` (superset-signature invariant
  pinned in a comment); 503/500 failure surfaces carry a correlation ref
  (`(ref XXXX)`) matching the backend log line — the frontend toast already
  renders server detail. Regression: `TestRicoProfileSaveThroughRealWrapper`
  exercises the REAL wrapper, patching one layer down — verified failing
  (503) against the pre-fix code; 4/4 with the fix. Backend suite 3,968 green.

### TASK-20260718-019 — PR #1167: route-exit dirty-state protection (Profile track Phase 4)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed (frontend-only)**
Owner: Claude (owner-authorized autonomous track execution 2026-07-18)

Issue/PR: #1167 (squash `ae6567871beffdab4ebff3b68bee8d5d75863908`)

#### Delivered

- Closes the #1161 residual P1: browser Back exiting `/profile` is made
  non-destructive — per-tab, account-keyed sessionStorage draft mirror,
  restored with the unsaved bar on return; removed on save/discard;
  foreign-account drafts ignored AND wiped; corrupt storage → clean start.
  No history trap (would break section back/forward), no shell/router change.
  All #1161 guards unchanged. 8 new tests (`profile-draft-persistence.test.tsx`);
  full vitest 711/68 green.

### TASK-20260718-018 — PR #1166: explicit-null clearing for numeric profile fields

Issue/PR: #1166 (squash `0da1c3e23647f6b5bc5529cab8e57214b860e21c`)

#### Delivered

- Defect confirmed real at three layers (Pydantic omitted≡null; repo
  None-strip; mirror None-skip). Contract: omitted=unchanged, explicit
  null=clear, 0=valid, invalid=422 — for `salary_expectation_aed`,
  `minimum_salary_aed`, `years_experience` only. Additive `clear_fields`
  channel (endpoint `model_fields_set` → repo allowlist → JSONB `||` null
  write → mirror clear post-commit); **no migration, no schema change**;
  every existing caller's None-means-unchanged semantics preserved; #764
  verifier checks merged expected state. 13 new backend tests + frontend
  clear-saves-null/zero-valid tests; backend 3,964 + frontend 703 green.

### TASK-20260718-017 — PR #1165: actionable profile warnings (Profile Phase 4B)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed ("Deploy to Production" success)**
Owner: Claude (owner-authorized autonomous track execution 2026-07-18)

Issue/PR: #1165 (squash `ab7075940a309293e6f0738fc7a6553b30ce1577`)

#### Delivered

- Passive `/profile` warning banner → actionable workflow on the Phase 4A
  contract: live count summary (EN/AR singular/plural), blocking-first
  severity badges, direct actions on stable field identifiers
  (`target_roles`/`preferred_cities` → `?section=goals` + param preservation +
  exact-field focus + reduced-motion-safe highlight + SR announcement;
  settings-owned fields → `/settings`), authoritative save-refresh removal +
  hide-when-empty, blocking non-dismissable, session-scoped Review-later with
  restore (never claims resolution). Frontend-only; 16 new vitest cases +
  focused Playwright (EN + AR RTL, screenshots as uncommitted artifacts).

### TASK-20260718-016 — PR #1164: backend-authoritative warning severity contract (Profile Phase 4A)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed ("Deploy to Production" success)**
Owner: Claude (owner-authorized autonomous track execution 2026-07-18)

Issue/PR: #1164 (squash `63e976d0a06144c28f447ace210ccc453dd5d72f`)

#### Delivered

- `WarningSeverity` enum (`blocking`/`important`/`recommendation`);
  explicit `WARNING_SEVERITY_BY_CODE` + `WARNING_FIELD_BY_CODE` for all 6
  emitted matching-guardrail codes (blocking:
  `excluded_keyword_blocks_target_role`, `invalid_uae_city`; important:
  `excluded_keyword_overlaps_included_keyword`,
  `excluded_keyword_blocks_core_role_word`, `minimum_fit_score_high`;
  recommendation: `too_many_target_roles`); fail-safe `severity_for_code()`
  (unknown → logged + deterministic `important`, unreachable in a green build
  via the exhaustive contract test). Response shape + bilingual contract
  preserved; `cv_quality_warnings` untouched; no DB change.

### TASK-20260718-015 — PR #1161: profile true URL-backed section navigation (Profile Phase 3)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed (frontend-only)**
Owner: Claude (Release Captain pass; owner-approved merge 2026-07-18)
Branch: `feat/profile-true-section-navigation` (merged, auto-deleted)
Issue/PR: #1161 (squash `76e52984d0c052dfa9528844bcbb587c032ab021`)

#### Objective

Replace the /profile visual-only section rail (shipped by #1152) with true
URL-backed section navigation. Completes **Profile Phase 3**.

#### Delivered

- `?section=` drives a render-only-selected switch (one section at a time; the old
  IntersectionObserver scroll-spy is removed). Deep links, in-`/profile`
  back/forward, and refresh resolve from the URL; missing→about (URL left clean),
  invalid→about (canonicalized with `replace`), explicit valid section wins; every
  unrelated query param (incl. the #1159 Gmail callback → Integrations) is preserved.
  Unsaved draft survives section switches; `beforeunload` guards refresh/close and a
  profile-scoped capture-phase interceptor guards internal cross-route nav while
  dirty; mobile `<select>`; heading focus on intentional change; RTL mirrored.
- Files: `apps/web/components/profile/ProfileEditorial.tsx`,
  `apps/web/app/profile/page.tsx`, `apps/web/lib/translations.ts` (+2 EN/AR keys),
  `apps/web/__tests__/profile-editorial.test.tsx`. 4 files, +467/−80. Frontend only —
  no backend/schema/API/migration/Gmail/warning/billing change.

#### Deferred / not in scope (still QUEUED)

- **Browser Back that EXITS `/profile`** is not intercepted (refresh/close + internal
  `<Link>` nav ARE; in-profile section back/forward preserves the draft). Owner-accepted
  as a **separate P1**: *Profile cross-route dirty-state protection* at the shared
  WorkspaceShell/navigation layer. Not branched, not implemented.
- **Profile Phase 4A** (backend warning severity contract) and **Phase 4B** (actionable
  warning frontend) — NOT started.

#### Verification

- Rebased onto `main` `f10498cd` (head `b688cdc8`); focused `profile-editorial.test.tsx`
  **32/32**; `next build` clean; full CI green (frontend/pytest/playwright/
  postgres-integration/workflow-security-guards); 0 review threads; `mergeable_state`
  clean. Squash `76e52984`; **"Deploy to Production" run for `76e52984` = success**.
- **Owner live authenticated `/profile` + Arabic RTL visual smoke on `ricohunt.com`
  still PENDING** (production host network-blocked from the executing session).

### TASK-20260718-007 — Stage 1: Neon data-architecture audit + source-of-truth decision record (docs-only)

Status: review (draft PR open; owner approval is the stop condition)
Owner: Claude (WRITER on `claude/database-audit-results-qcurpe`)
Branch: `claude/database-audit-results-qcurpe`

- Audit baseline (evidence gathered at): `main` @ `4ce678b6`
- Current PR base after reconciliation with main: `main` @ `197d946`
- PR head before this correction pass: `c3cdb95`
Issue/PR: Stage 1 audit PR #1160 (docs-only)
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M0 — audit + canonical decisions
→ Phase: Phase 0 (evidence)
→ Proposed PR objective: publish the verified audit + proposed decision
  matrix + phased task ledger, docs-only
→ Task: TASK-20260718-007

#### Objective

Produce the verified, read-only Neon production architecture audit and the
proposed source-of-truth decision matrix; no production or runtime change.

#### Scope / files

- `AI_WORKSPACE/AUDITS/2026-07-18-neon-data-architecture-audit.md` (new)
- `AI_WORKSPACE/DECISIONS.md` (DEC-20260718-001, proposed)
- `AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md` (this ledger)

#### Risks

Docs-only; only risk is stale numbers — every figure is dated 2026-07-18 and
sourced (repo `file:line` or aggregate live query).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Every material claim carries repo or aggregate-DB evidence
- [x] No PII/secrets in the diff (aggregate counts only)
- [x] No runtime files changed; no SQL beyond SELECT/catalog reads
- [ ] Owner approves DEC-20260718-001 rows (moves to Accepted)

#### Rollback plan

- Before merge: close PR #1160 without merge; production and runtime remain
  unchanged.
- After squash merge: revert the resulting squash-merge commit.

Dependencies: none. Production impact: none. Neon changes: none.
Documentation impact: adds the canonical audit + proposed decision + phased
task ledger (Phases 1–7 below).

### TASK-20260718-008 — Phase 1 (umbrella): protect and document the production Neon branch

Status: proposed (execution gated only on explicit owner approval of branch
protection itself — NOT on acceptance of the full DEC-20260718-001 matrix)
Owner: owner-gated (Neon console) with agent-prepared checklist
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M1 — production containment
→ Phase: Phase 1 (single-slice milestone)
→ Proposed PR objective: see slice 1A (the only slice)
→ Task: TASK-20260718-008 (subtask 008-1A)

A Phase is an umbrella milestone, not a PR. Each slice = one PR / one change
window with exactly one objective. Slices are never combined.

#### Slice 1A — enable production branch protection

- **Objective (one):** turn on Neon branch protection for `production`
  (`br-restless-cherry-amq6wj7o`) and document the branch/backup model.
- **Scope:** one Neon console setting + one AI_WORKSPACE doc section; no
  schema, no code, no data.
- **Risk:** preview-branch automation (Vercel/GitHub create children of
  production — 216 live examples) must be confirmed unaffected first.
- **Acceptance:** branch shows `protected: true`; a test preview branch still
  creates successfully; branch/backup model documented.
- **Rollback:** toggle protection off (one console action, documented).
- **Depends on (only):** (1) explicit owner approval; (2) verification that
  protection does not break Vercel/GitHub preview-branch creation; (3) the
  documented toggle-off rollback above. NOT gated on Neon Data API status,
  the Render `DATABASE_URL` role, or acceptance of the full
  DEC-20260718-001 matrix — those verifications live exclusively in slice
  2A (TASK-20260718-009). **Production impact:** none to data.
  **Docs impact:** branch model section in AI_WORKSPACE.

### TASK-20260718-009 — Phase 2 (umbrella): database access boundary and least privilege

Status: proposed
Owner: agent-prepared on a non-production Neon branch; owner-gated cutover
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M2 — least-privilege access boundary
→ Phase: Phase 2 (umbrella; slices 2A–2E, one PR each)
→ Proposed PR objectives: per slice below
→ Task: TASK-20260718-009 (subtasks 009-2A … 009-2E)

Never combined: runtime-role creation, Render cutover, grant revocation, and
RLS rollout are four separate change windows.
Umbrella docs impact: access model documented in AI_WORKSPACE.

#### Slice 2A — verify Data API and runtime access paths (read-only)

- **Objective (one):** record Data API enabled/disabled state (console) and
  inventory every path that connects to `neondb` (Render, workflows, MCP,
  previews), including the role each uses.
- **Scope:** read-only verification + one docs update. **Risk:** none
  (read-only). **Acceptance:** audit §14 items 1–2 closed with evidence.
- **Rollback:** n/a. **Depends on:** TASK-008. **Production impact:** none.

#### Slice 2B — create and test a limited runtime role (non-production)

- **Objective (one):** create the least-privilege FastAPI role and prove the
  full backend test suite + API smoke green under it on a Neon test branch.
- **Scope:** role + grants on a test branch only; zero production change.
- **Risk:** under-granting breaks runtime paths — that is what the test
  branch is for. **Acceptance:** suite + smoke green under the new role.
- **Rollback:** delete the test branch. **Depends on:** 2A.
- **Production impact:** none.

#### Slice 2C — cut Render to the limited role

- **Objective (one):** switch Render's `DATABASE_URL` to the proven limited
  role in one change window.
- **Scope:** one env-var change; no code. **Risk:** missed grant surfaces in
  production — mitigated by 2B parity + post-cutover smoke.
- **Acceptance:** `/health`, auth, chat, applications smoke green; live
  sessions show the new role. **Rollback:** restore the previous connection
  string (instant). **Depends on:** 2B. **Production impact:** one
  change window.

#### Slice 2D — revoke unnecessary `authenticated` grants

- **Objective (one):** revoke the blanket 44-table CRUD from `authenticated`
  (and review `anonymous`), keeping only what 2A's inventory proves needed.
- **Scope:** REVOKE statements, staged on the test branch first. **Risk:**
  breaking a legitimate Data-API consumer — none is known; 2A is the guard.
- **Acceptance:** grants match the documented access model; runtime
  unaffected. **Rollback:** re-GRANT from the recorded previous state.
- **Depends on:** 2C. **Production impact:** one change window.

#### Slice 2E — introduce tested RLS policies incrementally

- **Objective (one):** add user-scoping RLS policies table-group by
  table-group, each group with cross-user denial tests on the test branch
  before production.
- **Scope:** policies only; never a bulk flip; the 17 policy-less
  RLS-enabled tables are regularized in the same passes. **Risk:** a wrong
  policy blocks legitimate access — per-group rollout keeps blast radius
  small. **Acceptance:** cross-user read/write proven denied per group;
  product smoke green after each group. **Rollback:** drop the group's
  policies. **Depends on:** 2C (limited role in place; RLS is meaningless
  under BYPASSRLS). **Production impact:** one change window per group.

### TASK-20260718-010 — Phase 3 (umbrella): canonical identity reconciliation

Status: proposed
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M3 — one identity spine (`rico_users.id` UUID)
→ Phase: Phase 3 (umbrella; slices 3A–3E, one PR each)
→ Proposed PR objectives: per slice below
→ Task: TASK-20260718-010 (subtasks 010-3A … 010-3E)

Never combined: identity reporting, data reconciliation, merge
implementation, and constraints are separate PRs.
Umbrella docs impact: identity map updated in audit + ARCHITECTURE.

#### Slice 3A — identity mapping report (read-only)

- **Objective (one):** produce the full identifier-family mapping report
  (users ↔ rico_users ↔ text-keyed tables ↔ guests), aggregate-only.
- **Scope:** read-only queries + one AI_WORKSPACE report. **Risk:** none.
- **Acceptance:** every table's identity key mapped; unlinkable rows
  itemized by class. **Rollback:** n/a. **Depends on:** DEC approval.
- **Production impact:** none.

#### Slice 3B — duplicate-email resolution plan

- **Objective (one):** dry-run resolution plan for the 3 duplicate-email
  groups in `rico_users` (which row survives, where children re-point).
- **Scope:** plan + dry-run report; no writes until owner approves.
- **Risk:** wrong merge joins two real people — exact verified-email match
  only. **Acceptance:** owner-approved per-group plan. **Rollback:** n/a
  (docs). **Depends on:** 3A. **Production impact:** none (execution rides
  the 3C window).

#### Slice 3C — orphan/guest classification and reconciliation

- **Objective (one):** classify and reconcile the 121 onboarding + 12
  job-context + 2 document-context unlinkable rows (link, mark
  guest-expired, or archive) with a reviewed idempotent script.
- **Scope:** one scripted data window, backup branch first; script logs
  every row touched. **Risk:** mislinking a guest row to the wrong account —
  linking requires an exact-key match, else classify-not-link.
- **Acceptance:** unlinkable counts → 0 or documented-guest; no orphan rows
  introduced. **Rollback:** restore from the pre-window backup branch.
- **Depends on:** 3B approved. **Production impact:** one data change
  window.

#### Slice 3D — implement the real guest/auth identity merge

- **Objective (one):** replace the no-op `_attempt_identity_merge`
  (`src/agent/identity/resolver.py:194–219`) with a real merge using the
  044 `guest_identity_claims` single-owner invariant.
- **Scope:** runtime code + tests; no data migration in this PR. **Risk:**
  merge races — 044's PK + same-transaction claim is the guard, covered by
  tests. **Acceptance:** guest→auth merge works end-to-end in tests; a
  second claim on the same guest fails closed. **Rollback:** revert the
  code PR. **Depends on:** 3C. **Production impact:** deploy only.

#### Slice 3E — add identity constraints

- **Objective (one):** enforce what 3A–3D made true:
  `rico_profiles.user_id`, `rico_job_recommendations.user_id`,
  `rico_chat_history.user_id` → `CHECK … NOT VALID → VALIDATE →
  SET NOT NULL` (no table rewrite).
- **Scope:** one additive constraint migration. **Risk:** validation fails
  if stragglers exist — 3C acceptance is the precondition.
- **Acceptance:** constraints VALID; drift signature added. **Rollback:**
  drop the constraints (non-destructive). **Depends on:** 3C, 3D.
- **Production impact:** one change window.

### TASK-20260718-011 — Phase 4 (umbrella): application lifecycle reconciliation

Status: proposed
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M4 — one application ledger (`rico_job_recommendations`)
→ Phase: Phase 4 (umbrella; slices 4A–4E, one PR each)
→ Proposed PR objectives: per slice below
→ Task: TASK-20260718-011 (subtasks 011-4A … 011-4E)

Never combined: dry-run, reconciliation writes, write-freeze, linkage, and
constraints are separate PRs. Umbrella docs impact: lifecycle map updated.

#### Slice 4A — lifecycle reconciliation dry-run

- **Objective (one):** produce the row-by-row dry-run report for the 5
  context-`applied` + 2 legacy-`applied` + 1 `interview_scheduled` records
  (the ujc→rjr match is heuristic — no shared key — so every row is
  resolved explicitly, never bulk-matched).
- **Scope:** read-only report. **Risk:** none. **Acceptance:**
  owner-approved disposition per row. **Rollback:** n/a.
- **Depends on:** TASK-010 (canonical user resolution). **Production
  impact:** none.

#### Slice 4B — reconcile approved records

- **Objective (one):** write the 4A-approved records into
  `rico_job_recommendations` via a reviewed idempotent script.
- **Scope:** one scripted data window, backup branch first. **Risk:**
  double-insert — the `(user_id, job_key)` unique upsert path is the guard.
- **Acceptance:** canonical table reflects every real application; quota/
  stats counts match. **Rollback:** restore from the pre-window backup
  branch. **Depends on:** 4A. **Production impact:** one data change window.

#### Slice 4C — freeze legacy `applications` writes

- **Objective (one):** add a repo-layer guard so no code path writes new
  rows to legacy `applications`.
- **Scope:** code + tests only. **Risk:** a legacy pipeline path still
  expecting writes — inventory first, guard logs instead of raising.
- **Acceptance:** guard covered by tests; zero new rows in production over
  an observation window. **Rollback:** revert the code PR.
- **Depends on:** 4B. **Production impact:** deploy only.

#### Slice 4D — shared job identity/linkage

- **Objective (one):** give `user_job_context` a durable link to canonical
  job identity (job_key or FK) so context↔ledger matching is exact, ending
  the heuristic gap 4A worked around.
- **Scope:** one additive migration + backfill script + repo update.
- **Risk:** wrong backfill link — backfill only on exact-URL matches, else
  leave NULL. **Acceptance:** new context rows always carry the link;
  backfill report reviewed. **Rollback:** additive column, harmless to
  leave; revert code. **Depends on:** 4B. **Production impact:** one
  change window.

#### Slice 4E — status constraints and lifecycle smoke

- **Objective (one):** add status CHECK constraints
  (`rico_job_recommendations`, `user_job_context`; `NOT VALID → VALIDATE`)
  and run the full lifecycle smoke
  (search → open → prepared → applied → follow-up → interview).
- **Scope:** one constraint migration + smoke run. **Risk:** unknown status
  values — live scan showed none (audit §10). **Acceptance:** constraints
  VALID; smoke green; drift signatures added. **Rollback:** drop
  constraints. **Depends on:** 4B–4D. **Production impact:** one change
  window.

### TASK-20260718-012 — Phase 5 (umbrella): migration drift resolution

Status: proposed
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M5 — zero silent drift
→ Phase: Phase 5 (umbrella; slices 5A–5D, one PR each)
→ Proposed PR objectives: per slice below
→ Task: TASK-20260718-012 (subtasks 012-5A … 012-5D)

Never combined: the Gmail 043 window, the 034 index cleanup, and the
drift-detector code change are separate PRs.
Umbrella docs impact: drift-detector README section.

#### Slice 5A — Gmail migration 043 change window

- **Objective (one):** apply 043 to production in an owner change window
  (additive DDL), before any `RICO_ENABLE_GMAIL_SYNC=true`.
- **Scope:** one migration apply + drift verification; no code, no flag
  change. **Risk:** low (additive, idempotent); backup branch first per the
  044 pattern. **Acceptance:** all seven 043 drift signatures PRESENT.
- **Rollback:** documented DROP rollback in the migration footer.
- **Depends on:** owner window; coordinates with #1159 (frontend-only,
  feature stays disabled). **Production impact:** additive DDL.

#### Slice 5B — finish migration 034

- **Objective (one):** run the two remaining
  `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS` statements
  (`idx_rico_job_recommendations_user_job_key`,
  `idx_rico_profiles_user_id`) — both live-verified as non-unique shadows
  of constraint-owned unique indexes (audit §11 Class B).
- **Scope:** two concurrent drops, one window. **Risk:** minimal — covered
  by the surviving unique indexes; EXPLAIN spot-check first anyway.
- **Acceptance:** both absent; upsert path (`ON CONFLICT`) smoke green.
- **Rollback:** recreate from saved definitions. **Depends on:** owner
  window. **Production impact:** two concurrent index drops.

#### Slice 5C — DROP/absence drift detection

- **Objective (one):** extend `scripts/check_migration_drift.py` with
  absence checks so DROP-only migrations (034 and future ones) can no
  longer stay silently unapplied.
- **Scope:** detector code + unit tests only. **Risk:** false alarms —
  covered by tests. **Acceptance:** detector flags a simulated
  unapplied-DROP; 034 signatures included. **Rollback:** revert the code
  PR. **Depends on:** none (can land before 5B; it would then correctly
  report 034 drift until 5B runs). **Production impact:** none.

#### Slice 5D — verify scheduled drift alerting

- **Objective (one):** confirm the drift check runs on a schedule against
  production and its failure alert reaches the admin/dev channel
  (`admin_ci` routing), fixing the wiring if absent.
- **Scope:** CI workflow verification/config only. **Risk:** none.
- **Acceptance:** a forced failure produces an admin alert; schedule
  evidence recorded. **Rollback:** revert workflow change. **Depends on:**
  5C. **Production impact:** none.

### TASK-20260718-013 — Phase 6 (umbrella): index and retention cleanup

Status: proposed
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M6 — lean indexes + documented retention
→ Phase: Phase 6 (umbrella; slices 6A–6D, one PR each)
→ Proposed PR objectives: per slice below
→ Task: TASK-20260718-013 (subtasks 013-6A … 013-6D)

Never combined: index cleanup and retention automation are separate PRs.
Umbrella docs impact: retention policy in AI_WORKSPACE.

#### Slice 6A — index classification

- **Objective (one):** complete the Class A–D inventory of audit §11 —
  including Class C overlap/partial cases not captured by the
  signature-identical query — with per-index EXPLAIN evidence, code-path
  notes (e.g. the `ON CONFLICT` partial unique), and drift-signature
  membership.
- **Scope:** read-only analysis on a Neon test branch + docs. **Risk:**
  none. **Acceptance:** every index classified with an evidence line;
  drop-list is the explicit Class A + proven Class B shadows only.
- **Rollback:** n/a. **Depends on:** TASK-012 (5B done first so the 034
  leftovers exit the list). **Production impact:** none.

#### Slice 6B — small concurrent index-drop batches

- **Objective (one):** drop only the indexes independently proven redundant
  in 6A, in small `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY` batches (never Class D
  constraint-owned indexes; never on `idx_scan=0` or signature-listing
  evidence alone).
- **Scope:** one batch per window, each preceded by an EXPLAIN re-check.
- **Risk:** removing a useful planner path — per-index evidence + small
  batches + saved definitions bound it. **Acceptance:** every 6A-approved
  index removed; no query-plan regression in the post-batch smoke; all
  constraint-owned indexes and the upsert partial unique untouched.
  (The goal is NOT zero overlapping signatures — only proven-redundant
  removals.)
- **Rollback:** recreate from saved definitions. **Depends on:** 6A.
- **Production impact:** concurrent drops only.

#### Slice 6C — retention policy

- **Objective (one):** document owner-approved retention windows for
  expired `password_reset_tokens` (16/16 expired live),
  `email_verification_tokens` (130/132), `cv_upload_artifacts` (2/2),
  `paddle_checkout_sessions` (13/13), plus webhook/audit log aging.
- **Scope:** docs only (AI_WORKSPACE). **Risk:** none. **Acceptance:**
  policy covers every temporary-record table with a window and a legal/
  audit rationale. **Rollback:** n/a. **Depends on:** DEC approval.
- **Production impact:** none.

#### Slice 6D — cleanup worker/schedule

- **Objective (one):** implement the 6C policy as a feature-flagged,
  batched, metric-emitting scheduled cleanup.
- **Scope:** worker/cron code + tests; flag default OFF, enabled in its own
  window. **Risk:** over-deletion — batch deletes with policy-derived
  predicates + dry-run mode + metrics. **Acceptance:** expired backlog
  drains; steady-state counts stay bounded; metrics visible.
- **Rollback:** flag OFF. **Depends on:** 6C. **Production impact:**
  scheduled deletes of expired records only.

### TASK-20260718-014 — Phase 7 (umbrella): legacy table isolation or retirement

Status: proposed
Traceability: Vision: Rico Career OS — trustworthy user data
→ Epic: Neon data architecture remediation (DEC-20260718-001)
→ Milestone: M7 — every table maps to a class in audit §12
→ Phase: Phase 7 (umbrella; slices 7A–7D — four INDEPENDENT decisions,
  never one PR)
→ Proposed PR objectives: per slice below
→ Task: TASK-20260718-014 (subtasks 014-7A … 014-7D)

Never combined: `leads`, Stripe retirement, legacy `applications`
retirement, and `search_context` are independent decisions and PRs.
Umbrella docs impact: final inventory update in the audit.

#### Slice 7A — `leads` isolation

- **Objective (one):** owner confirms data ownership (zero repo code paths;
  sibling `eco-technology-leads` Neon project exists), then export/move the
  table out of the Rico production DB.
- **Scope:** export → verify → move/drop, one window. **Risk:** deleting
  unconfirmed-ownership data — export precedes any removal; ownership
  sign-off is a hard gate. **Acceptance:** `leads` no longer in `neondb`;
  export retained. **Rollback:** re-import the export. **Depends on:**
  owner confirmation. **Production impact:** one isolation window.

#### Slice 7B — Stripe-era retirement

- **Objective (one):** read-only freeze then retirement plan for
  `user_subscriptions` / `subscription_events` (aligns with #1066; already
  unused for entitlement per `src/subscription_plans.py:90–119`).
- **Scope:** freeze guard + plan doc; the eventual drop is its own
  owner-signed window. **Risk:** losing billing history — archive export
  before any drop. **Acceptance:** no code writes to Stripe tables;
  retirement plan owner-signed. **Rollback:** revert guard.
- **Depends on:** #1066 owner decision. **Production impact:** none until
  the signed drop window.

#### Slice 7C — legacy `applications` pipeline retirement plan

- **Objective (one):** retirement plan for the legacy pipeline trio
  (`applications`, `auto_apply_attempts`, `weekly_reports`) after the
  lifecycle ledger is reconciled.
- **Scope:** plan + archival strategy; drops are separate signed windows.
- **Risk:** legacy pipeline still reading — usage inventory first.
- **Acceptance:** plan owner-signed; archives defined. **Rollback:** n/a
  (docs until execution). **Depends on:** TASK-011 (4B/4C done).
- **Production impact:** none until execution.

#### Slice 7D — `search_context` decision

- **Objective (one):** delete-or-wire decision for dormant `search_context`
  (repo docstring declares it DORMANT; table live with 0 relevant rows).
- **Scope:** decision + either a removal migration or an explicit wiring
  plan — never silently left ambiguous. **Risk:** none (dormant, unused).
- **Acceptance:** DECISIONS.md entry; table either scheduled for removal or
  assigned an owner feature. **Rollback:** table is recreatable from
  migration history. **Depends on:** DEC approval. **Production impact:**
  none until execution.

### TASK-20260718-006 — PR #1157: plain-language terminology in user-facing copy (EN+AR)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed; owner production visual smoke pending**
Owner: Claude (release owner; owner directive 2026-07-18 — approved to finalize+merge)
Branch: `fix/ui-copy-plain-language` (merged, deleted)
Issue/PR: #1157 (merged as squash commit `4ce678b6400889ebfb838e00079c7dfa86fcaf7c`)

#### Objective

Remove technical product jargon from **user-facing copy only** — no internal
identifiers, translation KEY names, props, test IDs, routes, DB fields, API
contracts, or analytics identifiers renamed.

#### Delivered

- EN+AR value changes across nav / headings / buttons / states / helper text:
  Pipeline→Applications; Job Pipeline / Application Flow→Application tracking;
  Career preferences→Career goals (تفضيلات المسار→أهدافك المهنية); In pipeline→In
  applications; Save to pipeline→Save to applications; Pipeline score→Match score;
  Open Flow / Flow→Open applications / Applications; /applications headline "Your
  pipeline."→"Your applications." (مسار طلباتك.→طلباتك.); AR pipeline terms
  (مسار الطلبات / خط الوظائف / المسار)→طلبات التوظيف / متابعة طلبات التوظيف.
- Files: `apps/web/lib/translations.ts`, `components/applications/ApplicationsAtelier.tsx`,
  `components/landing/HowItWorks.tsx`, `components/layout/app-nav.ts`, and 4 test files.
- Deliberately preserved: translation key names, `CommandRail` `pipeline` prop,
  `command-rail-pipeline` testid, `pipeline_active` state key, career-path wording
  (`Career` / `المسار المهني`). The "no jargon remaining" finding is scoped to the
  `apps/web` product-copy surfaces scanned only (server/email/notification/stored
  copy NOT scanned).

#### Deferred / not in scope

- `Sessions → Conversations` (belongs to the Command Workspace program, not this task).

#### Verification

- Rebased onto post-#1151 main; head `e1e8337` → squash `4ce678b`.
- Full frontend vitest 657 pass; `npm run build` clean (41/41); lint clean on changed files.
- CI all green; 0 review threads; `mergeable_state: clean`.
- Production: "Deploy to Production" run #997 for `4ce678b` = success (health + `ricohunt.com`
  reachability + `/proxy/health`). **Owner live terminology visual smoke pending.**

### TASK-20260718-005 — PR #1151: structured Rico reply presentation (safe markdown) + motion polish

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed; owner production visual smoke pending**
Owner: Claude (release owner; owner directive 2026-07-18 — approved to finalize first)
Branch: `feat/command-reply-motion-arabic-type` (merged, deleted)
Issue/PR: #1151 (merged as squash commit `965dd6404e6be2d0f2c3b3a06e1b1031ad3c2774`)

#### Objective

Render the **same** answer string the `/command` transcript already receives as
safe, structured markdown, plus the reply-motion layer. No change to response
content, prompts, backend routing, APIs, providers, or DB — frontend
reply-presentation only.

#### Delivered

- `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `skipHtml` renderer (`RicoReplyMarkdown.tsx`, new):
  headings, lists, emphasis, blockquotes, inline + fenced code, sanitized links
  (allowlist http/https/mailto/relative; `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:`/`file:`/
  entity-encoded → inert span; `rel="noopener noreferrer"`), no class/style/HTML
  injection, markdown renders during streaming, reduced-motion caret.
- Files: 13 (+593/−34) incl. `RicoReply.tsx`, motion layer (`fonts.ts`, `tokens.ts`,
  `CommandComposer/Messages/ObsidianShell.tsx`, `JobMatchCardAtelier.tsx`,
  `WorkspaceShell.tsx`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `vitest.setup.ts`), and two new test
  files (`rico-reply-markdown.test.tsx`, `rico-reply-markdown-security.test.tsx`).

#### Verification

- Base `6b62a11` → approved head `a4e7b44` → squash `965dd64`.
- Focused renderer+security+transcript 50 pass; full frontend vitest 657 pass;
  `npm run build` clean; lint clean on changed files; Playwright matrix (EN light/dark,
  AR RTL light/dark, mobile 390px, streaming, reduced-motion) captured.
- CI all green; 0 review threads; `mergeable_state: clean`.
- Production: "Deploy to Production" run #996 for `965dd64` = success. **Owner live
  `/command` structured-reply visual smoke pending.**

### TASK-20260718-004 — PR #1155: explicit Arabic job search reaches the search router (not CV-status)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed (Render backend); owner AR production smoke pending**
Owner: Claude (release owner; owner directive 2026-07-18 — approved to finalize+merge first)
Branch: `fix/arabic-jobsearch-vs-cv-status` (merged, deleted)
Issue/PR: #1155 (merged as squash commit `6b62a114771d4da5ed775632703f78da7f92dde6`)

#### Objective

Post-#1153 Arabic-only defect: the second CV-guidance gate in
`_handle_active_user_inner` intercepted explicit Arabic job searches
("ابحث عن وظائف تناسب سيرتي الذاتية") as CV-status guidance.

#### Delivered

- Guard added: the gate now also requires `not is_explicit_job_listing_request(message)`
  — the same canonical public predicate the search router keys on (reused from #1153;
  no duplicated intent logic). Files: `src/rico_chat_api.py` (+21/−1), new
  `tests/test_arabic_jobsearch_vs_cv_status.py` (unit + `_process_message_inner`
  production-path).

#### Deferred / not in scope

- Generic `_JOB_DOC_SCORE_RE` tightening (P1) — explicitly deferred by owner.

#### Verification

- Re-anchored; head `7a8f85d` → squash `6b62a11`.
- 8 targeted tests + regression sweep pass (57 on merged commit); CI all green;
  0 review threads; `mergeable_state: clean`.
- Production: Render backend deploy run #389 = success (gated on `/version` commit ==
  `6b62a11` + `/health` 200); the `main` "Deploy to Production" run for `6b62a11` also
  green. **Owner live Arabic `/command` routing smoke pending.**

### TASK-20260718-003 — PR #1156: legible guardrail-warnings banner on the editorial /profile

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed (contrast-only)**
Owner: Claude (release owner; owner directive 2026-07-18 — contrast-only scope)
Branch: `fix/profile-warnings-contrast` (merged, deleted)
Issue/PR: #1156 (merged as squash commit `25f19445343533c725916b96ab273fda598775c9`)

#### Objective

Fix the unreadable guardrail-warnings banner on the live editorial `/profile`
(contrast/legibility only).

#### Delivered

- `warning`/`warningTint` tone + scoped CSS so `role="alert"` warnings are legible
  in light and dark. `ProfileEditorial.tsx` + translations only.

#### Deferred / not in scope (still QUEUED — see TASK-20260718-... Phase 4)

- Actionable warning workflow: compact summary, severity model, section/field
  navigation, field focus/highlight, refresh-after-save, resolved-warning removal,
  live count, hide-when-empty, unsaved-edit integration. **NOT delivered here.**

#### Verification

- Squash `25f1944`; CI green; frontend build clean; production "Deploy to Production"
  run #994 = success.

### TASK-20260718-002 — PR #1152: rebuild /profile on the owner editorial design (real-data wiring)

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed (rebuild + visual section rail only)**
Owner: Claude (release owner; owner directive 2026-07 — profile editorial rebuild)
Branch: `feat/profile-editorial-rebuild` (merged, deleted)
Issue/PR: #1152 (merged as squash commit `cee1d6304...`)

#### Objective

Replace `/profile` with the uploaded editorial design, wired to the real system,
deleting the old profile code.

#### Delivered

- `ProfileEditorial.tsx` editorial rebuild: hero plate, profile-strength meter,
  **visual** sticky numbered section rail, 8 section cards, dirty-draft single-PATCH
  save bar; thin auth+data shell page; honest billing/Telegram states; "Verified email";
  numeric-clear validation. Real-data wired (`lib/api.ts`); auth-guard contract preserved.

#### Deferred / not in scope (DELIVERED 2026-07-18 by #1161 — see TASK-20260718-015)

- **True section navigation is NOT delivered *by this PR (#1152)*.** The rail here is
  visual only; true navigation shipped later in **#1161** (`76e52984`, Profile Phase 3).
  Was missing at #1152 time (all now delivered by #1161):
  render-only-selected-section, `/profile?section=…` URL state, deep links,
  back/forward, refresh persistence, invalid→about fallback, mobile selector,
  unsaved-edit protection, section focus management.

### TASK-20260718-001 — PR #1153: route "find jobs that match my CV" to job search, not job-doc scoring

Status: verified — **MERGED + deployed (English routing fix)**
Owner: Claude (release owner; owner directive 2026-07 — smallest P0 after read-only audit)
Branch: `fix/find-jobs-cv-routing` (merged, deleted)
Issue/PR: #1153 (merged as squash commit `14b2b2e63...`)

#### Objective

Fix the demonstrated English `/command` failure ("Find UAE jobs that match my CV"
→ "I don't have an uploaded job document yet") — smallest P0 fix.

#### Delivered

- Guard in `_handle_job_doc_action` so a score-intent that is an explicit job-listing
  request (`is_explicit_job_listing_request`) is not intercepted as job-doc scoring;
  production-path regression test; reused canonical public predicate (no broad except).

#### Deferred / not in scope

- **This was the English routing defect only — NOT a full authenticated
  route/API/database/storage/entitlement audit.** That full cross-route audit
  remains NOT STARTED. `_JOB_DOC_SCORE_RE` tightening (P1) deferred. (The Arabic
  equivalent was fixed separately in #1155.)

#### Verification

- Squash `14b2b2e`; CI green; production "Deploy to Production" (backend path) = success.

### TASK-20260717-008 — PR #1145: unify /command visuals with the shared WorkspaceShell

Status: verified — **#1145 PRODUCTION PASS** (merged main @ `ecd29a66`, deployed;
owner-confirmed on ricohunt.com 2026-07-17)
Owner: Claude (release owner; owner directive 2026-07-17 — "اعمل ما تراه مناسب"
after a completed read-only audit of #1145)
Branch: `fix/command-atelier-visual-consistency` (merged)
Issue/PR: #1145 (merged as squash commit `ecd29a66ac43301219ff04a3c5c7fe6b4711a33c`)

#### Objective

Visual/system unification only: make authenticated `/command` a clear part of
the Rico Workspace (shared `WorkspaceShell variant="app"`, single
`WORKSPACE_THEME` token source, light-first default with dark via the shared
toggle) with **zero** chat-behavior change — no endpoint, payload, streaming,
persistence, auth, or quota code touched. Implements DEC-20260717-001.

#### What changed

- `apps/web/components/command/CommandObsidianShell.tsx` — composes
  `WorkspaceShell variant="app"`; keeps only route-scoped console bar
  (status/panel toggles/account-logout), the 260px Sessions rail, and the
  rgba-aware CSS-var reply-surface layer derived from the ACTIVE shared palette
- `apps/web/components/command/commandAtelierTheme.ts` — **deleted** (copied
  token source; no duplicated palette remains)
- `apps/web/app/command/page.tsx` — chrome doc comment only, no logic change
- 3 command vitest specs repinned to the new contract (light default, shared
  palette, shared sidebar nav); composer hint raised ink40→ink70 for WCAG 4.5:1
- `AI_WORKSPACE/DECISIONS.md` — DEC-20260717-001 recorded

#### Verification

- CI on head `75cd1432` (post-rebase onto main `282660dd`): all 9 checks green
  (Setup, pytest, postgres-integration, frontend, playwright,
  workflow-security-guards, Create/Delete Neon Branch, Vercel) — no failures
- Local: `npx vitest run` 625/625; `npm run build` clean (`/command` 79.5 kB)
- Zero review threads / zero pending reviews; `mergeable_state: clean`
- Merged via squash with expected head SHA `75cd1432` → main now `ecd29a66`
- **Production: PASS** — owner confirmed `ricohunt.com/command` serves `ecd29a66`
  (light-first shared WorkspaceShell chrome, not the old forced-dark Obsidian
  console) on 2026-07-17

### TASK-20260717-007 — PR #1143: Paddle-only subscription checkout; remove manual/WhatsApp payment path

Status: verified — **#1143 PRODUCTION PASS** (merged main @ e903496, deployed)
Owner: Claude (WRITER; owner directive 2026-07-17 — "Proceed with #1143 only",
Paddle is the approved and only billing path)
Branch: `fix/subscription-paddle-runtime-ui` (merged)
Issue/PR: #1143 (merged as squash commit e903496)

#### Production smoke — PASS (owner-run on ricohunt.com, Paddle sandbox mode, 2026-07-17)

Seven-check gate, all confirmed with owner-supplied production evidence:

1. Paddle CTA "Subscribe with Paddle" / "اشترك عبر Paddle" visible (EN + AR) — PASS
2. No WhatsApp / manual-activation payment path or copy anywhere — PASS
3. Sandbox checkout completes (Paddle overlay "transaction completed") — PASS
4. Signed webhook processed (`POST /api/v1/billing/paddle/webhook`) — PASS
5. Neon subscription active (period end 2026-08-17) — PASS
6. `GET /api/v1/subscription/me` → `is_active: true`, plan `pro`, USD 21.50,
   Paddle customer + subscription IDs present — PASS
7. UI reflects Active/Current + "Manage Subscription" (Paddle customer portal) — PASS

Backend billing config confirmed live: `GET /api/v1/billing/config` →
`{"billing_mode":"paddle","paddle_active":true,"sandbox":true}`.

Real-money go-live (`PADDLE_SANDBOX=false` + live Paddle credentials on
Render/Vercel) is an OPTIONAL, owner-only dashboard step — NOT a prerequisite
for anything downstream. This smoke validated the flow end-to-end with Paddle
in sandbox mode.

### TASK-20260717-003 — #1080: enforce multipart upload limits before full buffering

Status: review
Owner: Claude (WRITER; Coder pass, owner-directed "full ownership" of the
2026-07-17 reconciliation-audit remediation sequence)
Branch: `fix/1080-bounded-upload-reads`
Issue/PR: #1080

#### Objective

Stop unauthenticated/oversized uploads from forcing full-body buffering:
cap the raw request body at the app ingress before multipart parsing, and
replace unbounded `file.read()` with bounded chunked reads on both upload
surfaces.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `src/api/upload_limits.py` (new), `src/api/app.py`,
  `src/api/routers/rico_chat.py`, `src/api/routers/files.py`
- Existing behavior: both routes checked the multipart-declared `file.size`
  then called `await file.read()` — the advertised 25 MB/10 MB limits were
  enforced only after the complete payload was materialized.

#### Constraints

- Keep the global 25 MB document cap and the 10 MB image rule (applied after
  bounded magic-byte detection) exactly as advertised.
- Friendly 413 messages unchanged.
- No proxy/CDN changes (Render ingress is outside this repo).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Missing/understated/chunked Content-Length stops at the cap
- [x] Peak bytes materialized bounded by limit + one chunk
- [x] Rejection never invokes classifier/parser/quota work
- [x] Temp file closed on rejection
- [x] Normal uploads and friendly messages unchanged

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `tests/test_1080_bounded_upload_reads.py` — 11 passed
      (wired into qa-tests.yml)
- [x] Regression: full local unit suite diffed vs clean-main baseline —
      only new failures were upload-route test fakes missing the real
      `read(size)` API; fakes fixed to model UploadFile correctly
- [ ] Frontend build: n/a
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke: normal CV upload + oversized rejection

  `tests/integration/test_user_documents_postgres.py` — upload fakes now
  model the real read(size) API; `.github/workflows/qa-tests.yml` — suite
  wired into CI
- Files intentionally not touched: Render/proxy ingress config (outside
  repo); concurrent-upload semaphore (rate limit already bounds request
  count — residual noted in PR)
- What is complete: ingress cap, bounded reads on both routes, tests
- What is incomplete: infrastructure-level (proxy) cap is an ops follow-up
- Known blockers: none

  43 passed; full-suite diff vs baseline clean after fake fixes
- Validation still required: CI on the PR head
- Deployment/CI/Neon/Vercel state to check next: QA Tests on the PR
- Next exact action: owner review of the draft PR
- Stop condition: any legitimate ≤25 MB upload rejected by the ingress cap
  → raise MULTIPART_OVERHEAD_BYTES instead of weakening the bound
- Rollback plan: revert the squash commit — routes return to unbounded
  read; no schema/data change

### TASK-20260717-004 — #1092: replace fake 200-row application pagination with canonical DB paging

Status: review
Owner: Claude (WRITER; Coder pass, owner-directed "full ownership" of the
2026-07-17 reconciliation-audit remediation sequence)
Branch: `fix/1092-canonical-db-pagination`
Issue/PR: #1092

#### Objective

Move application filtering, pagination, counting, stats, and single-record
lookup to the database boundary over ONE canonical logical record set — no
200-row cap, no in-Python dedup, no page-scan PATCH lookups.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `src/rico_db.py` (canonical CTE + new methods),
  `src/repositories/applications_repo.py`, `src/api/routers/applications.py`,
  `src/services/subscription_gating.py` (count_saved_jobs)
- Existing behavior: get_all() always fetched the newest 200 rows, deduped in
  Python, then the router sliced pages from that snapshot; find_by_job_id
  scanned the same 200 rows; stats derived from the capped list; gating
  counted saved jobs from it.

#### Constraints

- get_all() keeps its list contract — chat/agent callers unchanged.
- Physical write paths (upsert/update/job_key schemes) untouched.
- No migration required: (user_id, job_key) uniqueness (011/035) already
  exists; dedup of legacy multi-key rows is a read-boundary rule.
- Data-correctness work only — no provider run, no deploy in verification.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] 451 logical records + duplicates: every record reachable exactly once
      across pages with correct total/pages (real Postgres)
- [x] A status existing only beyond row 200 filters and counts correctly
- [x] PATCH addresses the oldest owned row directly; other users' rows never
      visible
- [x] Stats and quota counts run uncapped over the SAME canonical set as
      the pages
- [x] Insert-between-page-reads behavior documented and proven (repeat
      possible, never a silent skip)
- [x] BUG-3 dedup semantics preserved, now proven against real SQL

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: delegation-contract suite (rewritten
      `test_bug3_duplicate_kanban_entries.py`, CI-wired) + rewired
      isolation suites — all passing
- [x] Integration tests: `tests/integration/
      test_1092_applications_pagination_postgres.py` — 14 passed against a
      real local Postgres 16; wired into the postgres-integration CI job
- [x] Full local unit suite diffed vs clean-main baseline — zero new failures
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke: /applications page/total for a real account

  get_stats, direct find_by_job_id, dead Python dedup removed
  (_VALID_STATUSES kept — Gmail route imports it);
  `routers/applications.py` — list route delegates to get_page;
  `subscription_gating.py` — count_saved_jobs uses canonical count;
  integration + rewritten unit suites; qa-tests.yml wiring
- Files intentionally not touched: write paths' job_key derivation
  (write-time canonical identity is a follow-up design), cursor-based
  pagination (documented stable offset chosen per the issue's alternative)

### TASK-20260717-005 — #1086: one scheduled pipeline; generated dashboard off main; deploy path filters

Status: review
Owner: Claude (WRITER; Coder pass, owner-directed "full ownership" of the
2026-07-17 reconciliation-audit remediation sequence)
Branch: `fix/1086-single-scheduled-pipeline`
Issue/PR: #1086

#### Objective

Retire the duplicate scheduled pipeline, put every pipeline run behind one
queued lock, stop generated dashboard commits to main, and path-filter the
deploy workflows so docs/generated-only changes can never redeploy the
backend.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `.github/workflows/daily.yml`, `daily-job-bot.yml`,
  `deploy-render.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`
- Existing behavior: both daily workflows ran the same crons (06:00/15:00
  UTC), same `src.run_daily` + `src.follow_up`, no shared lock; both pushed
  regenerated `docs/index.html` to main (legacy even under `if: always()`
  with `|| echo` swallowing push failures); every dashboard commit
  re-triggered both deploy workflows.

#### Constraints

- No workflow dispatched or run as part of the fix.
- Apply/auto-action flags stay off.
- Keep a manual fallback for the legacy pipeline (dispatch-only).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Exactly one scheduled invocation owns run_daily + follow_up
- [x] Legacy workflow manual-only, sharing the SAME queued concurrency group
- [x] No workflow pushes to main; dashboard force-published to the dedicated
      `dashboard` branch only after pipeline success, failures loud
- [x] Deploy workflows auto-trigger only on runtime paths
- [x] OAuth temp files written from env vars, chmod 600, cleaned in always()
- [x] Static invariant suite enforces all of the above in CI

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `tests/test_1086_single_scheduled_pipeline.py` — 8 passed
      (CI-wired); `test_1084_workflow_guards.py` — 17 passed;
      `scripts/check_workflow_security.py` — OK, 16 files
- [x] YAML parse of all changed workflows
- [ ] Owner action after merge: point GitHub Pages at the `dashboard`
      branch `/docs` folder (one-time repo setting); until then the stale
      main copy of docs/index.html remains served

#### Residual fix (2026-07-18): dashboard orphan suppresses Vercel deployments

Follow-up to the #1086 dashboard-publish mechanism, on branch
`claude/vercel-dashboard-deployment-hygiene-yy7pzi` (separate Draft PR).

- Symptom: the dedicated `dashboard` orphan branch still triggered the `web`
  Vercel project (Root Directory `apps/web`), which auto-builds every pushed
  branch. Because the orphan carries no `apps/web` app tree, every publish
  produced ERROR deployments (two per publish: GitHub + Neon integrations) —
  deployment-history noise, no product impact. One user/profile/locale? No:
  the branch is global generated output, so the fix is global.
- Fix: the `deploy-dashboard` publish step now also writes `apps/web/vercel.json`
  into the orphan branch with `git.deploymentEnabled.dashboard=false` (Vercel's
  officially supported per-branch switch). Vercel evaluates it at ingestion,
  before Root-Directory validation, so no deployment is created for the
  `dashboard` ref.
- Proven by a reversible test push (dashboard `f22d2e8`): Vercel created ZERO
  deployments for that SHA (baseline `bccf308` had produced two ERROR
  deployments); `docs/index.html` blob byte-identical; main Production READY
  and PR Previews READY throughout.
- Scope: `.github/workflows/daily.yml` `deploy-dashboard` step only. The
  generated `apps/web/vercel.json` exists ONLY on the `dashboard` orphan, never
  on main's source tree. No change to main's `apps/web/vercel.json`, Vercel
  project settings, Root Directory, or application code.
- Preserved: main → production, normal PR branches → previews, GitHub Pages
  from the `dashboard` `/docs` folder.
- Rollback: revert the squash-merge commit; the next scheduled publish emits an
  orphan without `apps/web/vercel.json`, restoring prior behavior.
- Verify on the next natural scheduled run (do NOT dispatch for this): new
  dashboard commit contains both files; no Vercel deployment for that SHA;
  Pages opens; main Production READY; a normal PR Preview READY.
- Deployment/CI/Neon/Vercel state to check next: after merge, confirm a
  dashboard-only publish does NOT trigger deploy-render
- Next exact action: owner review; after merge, flip GitHub Pages source to
  the `dashboard` branch
- Stop condition: if the Pages flip is undesired, revert to discuss an
  actions/deploy-pages artifact flow instead
- Rollback plan: revert the squash commit — schedules and publication return
  to the previous (duplicated) behavior

### TASK-20260715-001 — Atelier migration: slice 4a — CommandComposer

Status: review
Owner: Claude (WRITER)
Branch: `feat/atelier-command-composer`
Issue/PR: #1028 (draft)

#### Objective

Rebuild PR #1028 as a real Atelier Command Composer migration (slice 4a only).
Replace the legacy extraction with a focused presentational `CommandComposer`
component that uses `WorkspaceThemeContext` palette tokens, adds the required
keyboard shortcuts (Enter, Shift+Enter, IME, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+J, Escape), and adds
29 tests covering all 13 required cases. Minimal diff in `page.tsx`.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `apps/web/components/command/CommandComposer.tsx`,
  `apps/web/app/command/page.tsx`, `apps/web/lib/translations.ts`,
  `apps/web/__tests__/command-composer.test.tsx`
- Relevant docs: `AI_WORKSPACE/ATELIER_FULL_SITE_MIGRATION.md`
- Existing behavior: all handlers and state live in `CommandPage` and are passed
  as props; no backend, streaming, or auth changes

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: other slices (empty state, message bubbles, tool cards, right
  rail, mobile header), backend/streaming/auth/billing
- No other routes touched
- Public/guest composer surface is unchanged in slice 4a

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Atelier authenticated surface: panel bg, ink, sun-red, mono hint
- [x] Public/guest surface unchanged
- [x] Enter sends, Shift+Enter newlines, IME guard, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+J, Escape
- [x] RTL mirroring for Arabic
- [x] 29 tests across 13 required cases — all green
- [x] `page.tsx` diff minimal: import, hidden-input removal, component swap
- [x] `npm run build` exit 0
- [x] Full vitest suite 416/416 green
- [ ] Playwright screenshots EN/AR desktop/mobile captured
- [ ] Owner visual review and approval

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `npx vitest run __tests__/command-composer.test.tsx` → 29/29
- [x] Full suite: `npx vitest run` → 416/416
- [x] Frontend build: `npm run build` → exit 0
- [ ] Playwright screenshots: EN desktop, EN mobile, AR desktop, AR mobile
- [ ] Owner visual review

### TASK-20260714-001 — Atelier full-site migration REOPENED: refreshed gap matrix + next-PR routing

Status: review
Owner: Claude (WRITER; Planner pass)
Branch: `claude/atelier-fullsite-reopen`
Issue/PR: this docs PR (draft); execution then follows Steps 1→8

#### Objective

Owner reopened the full-site Atelier migration (supersedes the 2026-07-14 program
closure). Flip `ATELIER_FULL_SITE_MIGRATION.md` from CLOSED/DEFERRED to REOPENED,
re-audit the route matrix against live `main`, and route execution to the next
existing in-flight Atelier PR without duplicating work.

**Unified target (updated 2026-07-16, DEC-20260716-001):** the migration target
is now **Atelier V3 as the single production-wide visual system** across
marketing, auth, the authenticated workspace, and `/command`, with dark mode
"**Atelier at Night**" derived from the same semantic tokens. This is the same
program — not a parallel design doc — with the end-state pinned by
`DEC-20260716-001` (which supersedes the Atelier/Nocturne split of
`DEC-20260708-003` and the preview-only stance of `DEC-20260709-006`).

Migration order (foundation-first, `/command` last):

1. Foundation — Atelier V3 semantic tokens + Atelier-at-Night dark set as the
   single source of truth.
2. Shared shell & controls adopt V3 tokens.
3. Low-risk workspace routes (settings/profile/applications/jobs), per-route.
4. `/command` **last** — owner decided 2026-07-16 to **re-skin** the completed
   `/command` slices (C1 tokens, C2 transcript adapter, C3 composer, C4 MATCH
   cards) from Obsidian acid-lime to the Atelier Console tokens (paper +
   Atelier at Night, sun-red), sourced from the existing `/rico-preview`
   Atelier Console. Structure/behavior preserved; token re-skin, not a rebuild.
   Obsidian acid-lime is historical reference only; C4–C6 do not continue under
   Obsidian styling.
5. Visual QA — EN/AR + RTL, light/dark, desktop/mobile parity.
6. Remove legacy Nocturne tokens once unreferenced.

Nocturne is historical/archive; `/rico-preview`, `/design-gallery`, and
`/design-preview` stay internal reference-only. Every production API, auth,
upload, billing, persistence, streaming, and agent contract is preserved — this
is a visual-token migration only; Lovable/reference surfaces are visual reference
only, never a source of behavior.

#### Context

- Target: **every** production user-facing route on the approved Atelier design,
  not the original seven surfaces.
- `main` advanced past the Phase-0 audit base `c11575d` → re-audited @ `5cf9a6f`.
- Existing in-flight PRs mapped: #1026 (Step 1 preview hygiene, VALID — next),
  #1016 (Step 3 `/queue` guard-only), #1022 (Step 7 Paddle runtime).
- Out of scope (owner): #1024/#1025 memory engine; abandoned M1 postgres branch.

#### Constraints

- Docs-only in this PR; no route/component/backend/billing/Neon changes.
- Preserve completed routes; do not rebuild unless a per-route audit proves
  residual legacy UI.
- No direct push to `main`; small draft PRs cut from latest `main`.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Program status flipped to REOPENED with owner directive recorded.
- [x] Route matrix re-audited from the live tree @ `5cf9a6f` (33 `page.tsx`).
- [x] Legacy-shell census recorded (`AppShell`, `DashboardShell` consumers).
- [x] Next existing Atelier PR identified (#1026, Step 1) and validity checked.

#### Required verification

- [x] Route audit: `find app -name page.tsx` + per-route shell grep + `next.config.js` redirects.
- [x] PR validity: #1026 base=`main`, Vercel preview green (bot checks are noise).
- [ ] Integration tests: n/a (docs-only).
- [ ] Frontend build: n/a (no `apps/web` code change).

### TASK-20260713-002 — Atelier migration program: parity matrix + first route PR (/applications)

Status: review
Owner: Claude (WRITER; activity pass: Planner → Coder)
Branch: `claude/atelier-migration-planning-mq6bt6`
Issue/PR: #1012 (draft; owner execution order 2026-07-13)

#### Objective

Own the Atelier Migration Program: publish the route parity matrix, migration order,
and component reuse report (`AI_WORKSPACE/ATELIER_MIGRATION_PROGRAM.md`), and land the
first implementation PR — migrate `/applications` off the legacy dark `/flow` page into
Workspace Shell C with an `ApplicationsAtelier` component.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `apps/web/app/applications/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/flow/page.tsx`,
  `apps/web/components/applications/ApplicationsAtelier.tsx` (new),
  `apps/web/components/workspace/*`, `apps/web/components/atelier-kit/*`,
  `apps/web/lib/applicationStatus.ts`, `apps/web/lib/translations.ts`
- Relevant docs: `AI_WORKSPACE/ATELIER_MIGRATION_PROGRAM.md`, `DEC-20260710-002`,
  `DEC-20260712-001`, `AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-07-10-design-preview-target-inventory.md`
- Existing behavior: `/applications` redirects to legacy Nocturne `/flow` (list/board,
  manual tracking, status updates) while Shell C's sidebar already links `/applications`.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: Paddle/billing (`/subscription` logic, #1008 files), auth logic,
  backend/API contracts, legacy `app-nav.ts` `/flow` contract (redirect covers it).
- No migrations required.
- Keep scope limited to: the `/applications` route group + its tests + program docs.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Parity matrix, migration order, and reuse report published.
- [x] `/applications` renders in Shell C with real data; `/flow` redirects to it.
- [x] Same API calls, translation keys, and status taxonomy (`STAGE_DEFS`) as before.
- [x] Existing flow behavior tests pass against the new page (import swap only).

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `npx vitest run __tests__/flow-manual-application.test.tsx __tests__/bug6-status-taxonomy.test.tsx`
- [ ] Integration tests: n/a (frontend-only)
- [x] Frontend build: `npm run build` in `apps/web`

### TASK-20260713-001 — Reconcile Rico control plane and record governed follow-up direction

Status: review
Owner: ChatGPT (writer) / independent review this session
Branch: `chore/agent-control-plane-reconciliation`
Issue/PR: #1010

#### Objective

Reconcile Rico's stale coordination layer with live GitHub state, establish the binding
execution sequence for interface completion, the one AED 79/month plan, invitations, and
controlled launch, and record (without expanding runtime scope) the governed long-term
direction for the Agent Operating System and the Rico-entity vision.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `AI_WORKSPACE/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `AI_WORKSPACE/START_HERE.md`,
  `AI_WORKSPACE/DAILY_AUTOPILOT.md`, `AI_WORKSPACE/OPEN_PR_TRIAGE_2026-07-13.md`,

  `AI_WORKSPACE/AGENT_OS_ROADMAP_AR.md`, `AI_WORKSPACE/VISION/RICO_ENTITY_AR.md`,
  `AI_WORKSPACE/FOLLOW_UPS/AGENT_OS_AND_RICO_ENTITY.md`
- Relevant docs: `AI_WORKSPACE/OPERATING_RULES.md` (canonical boot order)
- Existing behavior: previous workspace snapshot claimed a stale `60978ae…` main state;
  live main had already advanced through Atelier kit, Workspace Shell/dashboard, profile,
  settings, teaser/film, and verification-route fixes.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: runtime application code, database migrations, environment configuration,
  deployment configuration, billing provider configuration, production data.
- No migrations: none required (docs-only PR).
- Keep scope limited to: control-plane/coordination documentation only.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Open PRs classified (incl. Paddle PR #1008 held for #989 joint review; CI-housekeeping
      PR #988 held as non-launch).
- [x] `START_HERE.md`/`DAILY_AUTOPILOT.md` aligned with `OPERATING_RULES.md` canonical boot
      order (conflict found and corrected).
- [x] Branch-authority roles (WRITER/REVIEWER/RELEASE/IDLE) distinguished from activity-pass
      roles (Planner/Coder/Reviewer/Tester/Deploy verifier).
- [x] Agent OS roadmap and Rico-entity vision recorded as governed follow-up only (no runtime
      scope expansion; explicit "do not implement on ambition alone" gate).
- [x] This Continuity Block present in `AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md` before merge.
- [x] Final PR head/CI re-confirmed: head `255e0c69e8c5085233f28b214bfd498f915ef548` —
      pytest ✅ postgres-integration ✅ playwright ✅ frontend ✅ Vercel ✅ Create Neon Branch ✅.
      Independent review finding: stale next-action text (step 1 already done) — corrected
      in this truth-only commit.
- [ ] Independent approval + explicit owner merge approval obtained.

#### Required verification

- [ ] Integration tests: n/a (docs-only)
- [ ] Frontend build: n/a (no `apps/web` files touched)

### TASK-20260710-003 — Migrate the full `/design-preview` package to production (shape + content + flows)

Status: scoped — REVISED 2026-07-10 to full-package scope per `DEC-20260710-002`
(was "Phase 1: landing below-the-fold"). Blocked on owner decisions listed below.
Owner: unassigned
Branch: docs on `docs/design-preview-target-inventory`; implementation branches TBD
Issue/PR: #933 (landing below-the-fold, **paused draft** — see below); governed by
`DEC-20260710-002` (expands `DEC-20260710-001`)

#### Objective

Reproduce the approved `/design-preview` package in production — same visual language,
sections, content structure, page flows, desktop/mobile behavior, and EN/AR coverage — via
small per-route PRs with an owner visual-approval gate before each merge. Authoritative
reference inventory: `HANDOFFS/2026-07-10-design-preview-target-inventory.md` (53 PNGs,
6-group hub tile inventory, live `/design-gallery` + `/rico-preview`). The uploaded PDF is
not present in the agent environment; the in-repo `/design-preview` source is authoritative.

#### Recommended PR sequence (safest first, per DEC-20260710-002 §4)

PR 0 shared Atelier UI kit → PR 1 public landing (full parity) → PR 2 auth → PR 3 support/legal
→ PR 4 onboarding (after hybrid-state fix, TASK-20260710-005) → PR 5 workspace read surfaces →
PR 6 workspace action surfaces (billing-gated) → PR 7 command/chat (own DEC).

#### #933 decision

Recommend: keep #933 as a draft reference and make PR 1 the full public-landing parity that
supersedes it (revise-in-place if the owner unfreezes the hero and rules on #899; otherwise

# 933 does not merge). Do NOT merge #933 as below-the-fold-only

#### Owner-gated decisions before implementation

- [ ] Unfreeze the landing hero for PR 1 + decide #899's fate.
- [ ] Canonical onboarding flow: reference intent-flow vs production CV-first.
- [ ] Adopt the reference workspace left-sidebar (Shell C) in production?
- [ ] Support contact form + auth Google button: omit (recommended) or greenlight as separate
      backend projects.
- [ ] Approve starting PR 0 (shared Atelier UI kit).

#### Constraints

- Excluded/gated (DEC-20260710-002 §3): `/command` (own DEC); no backend/auth/billing/Neon/
  schema without approval; legal copy preserved verbatim; no shadcn without its own DEC;
  no fake live actions; preview/sample data wired to existing endpoints or clearly labelled.
- One objective per PR; owner visual approval before every merge; single-revert rollback.
- Note: draft PR #899 (landing hero polish, held under the #871 freeze) overlaps the hero —
  hero parity work must reconcile with it.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Per-phase uniform acceptance in `DEC-20260710-001` §5 (build, no new test failures,
      EN/AR RTL, mobile, owner preview approval pre-merge, post-merge smoke).
- [ ] Lighthouse/CLS not worse than current landing; sitemap/robots/meta unchanged.

#### Rollback

Revert the PR → Vercel auto-redeploy → re-smoke landing.

### TASK-20260710-004 — P2: stale apply-link tests + `test_agent.py` absent from CI

Status: proposed (audit 2026-07-10; does not block rollout)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: none yet

#### Objective

Three `tests/test_agent.py::TestApplyServiceIndeedMethod` tests encode the pre-trust-gate
link contract and fail on clean `main` (expect `success`/`manual_required`, get
`error: Job is missing a link` because the Phase-0 trust gate in
`src/services/job_link_trust.py` deliberately rejects non-source-backed URLs). CI's
`qa-tests.yml` pytest job never runs `tests/test_agent.py`, so this is invisible.
Test-only fix: update the 3 tests to the trust-gate contract (source-backed fixtures) and
consider adding `tests/test_agent.py` to the CI selection. Production behavior is correct
and unchanged (`RICO_ENABLE_AUTO_APPLY=false` in prod); do NOT weaken the trust gate.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `python -m pytest tests/test_agent.py -q` green on clean `main`.
- [ ] No `src/` behavior change.

### TASK-20260710-005 — P2: resolve `/onboarding` hybrid dead-UI state (Phase 4 gate)

Status: done (resolved via PR #955, merged + prod-deployed 2026-07-10; main `1238ff9` carries it)
Owner: Claude
Branch: `claude/onboarding-completion-signal-j8qmxz` (merged)
Issue/PR: #955

#### Objective

`next.config.js` redirects `/onboarding` → `/command` while a real 466-line
`apps/web/app/onboarding/page.tsx` still exists — the hybrid state prohibited by
`DEC-20260628-001` (No Dead UI rule). Owner decision then one small PR: either make the
route live (remove redirect) or strip `page.tsx` to nothing/thin passthrough. Must be
resolved before the Phase 4 onboarding-shell work in `DEC-20260710-001`.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Route is in exactly one legal state per the No Dead UI rule — `/onboarding` is now
  live/reachable (the `/onboarding → /command` redirect was removed; page rewritten to the
  Atelier island), routing on the backend `GET /api/v1/onboarding/status` signal.
- [x] CLAUDE.md "Key Frontend Files" entry for onboarding matches reality afterwards —
  verified: `apps/web/app/onboarding/page.tsx — guided onboarding / CV-first flow` is still
  accurate for the live route.
- [x] `/onboarding` is the real authenticated first-run flow per `DEC-20260710-004`.

### TASK-20260711-001 — Auth guard for authenticated account pages (/settings, /profile)

Status: done (merged PR #958 → main `1238ff9`; production-verified 2026-07-11)
Owner: Claude
Branch: `fix/guard-authenticated-account-pages` (merged)
Issue/PR: #958

#### Objective

Guests could render the private AppShell (`/settings`) or fire a private request that showed
a misleading connection error (`/profile`). Add a shared `useRequireAuth` + `AuthGate` guard
so authenticated-only pages wait for auth readiness, redirect guests to
`/login?next=<encoded path>`, never render the private shell, and fire no private API for a
guest. No backend/JWT/cookie/logout change; `/command` stays public; `/onboarding` unchanged.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] guest `/settings` → `/login?next=%2Fsettings`, no shell, no private API — **prod-verified**
- [x] guest `/profile` → `/login?next=%2Fprofile`, no shell, no private request — **prod-verified**
- [x] authenticated users retain normal access; neutral `AuthGate` while resolving; no loop
- [x] resolves smoke findings **#2** (`/settings` auth-boundary) and **#5** (`/profile` error)
- Follow-up (NOT started): apply the same guard to `/applications`, `/upload`, `/flow`,
  `/queue`; and the login-return-path `next` gap is tracked as **#962**.

> **Binding sequence (recorded 2026-07-11; do not reorder):**
> `#960` → `#963` → owner production smoke → onboarding PARTIAL becomes **VERIFIED**.
> `#960` is merged and production-smoke verified via #969. `#963` is merged via #975 and its
> authenticated production smoke is **owner-confirmed PASS (2026-07-11)** — onboarding is now
> **VERIFIED**. `#962` remains a separate later increment and is the next objective.

### TASK-20260711-002 — Exact CV duplicate protection and idempotency

Status: done (merged as #969; production-smoke verified)
Owner: Claude / owner release verification
Branch: merged
Issue/PR: #960 / #969

#### Objective

Server-side exact-duplicate detection, atomic idempotency, quota safety, and primary-CV
invariants for CV uploads. Foundation only — **no onboarding wiring in this task**.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] server-side exact-duplicate detection for CV uploads
- [x] atomic idempotency (safe under retries/concurrent submits)
- [x] quota safety and primary-CV invariants preserved
- [x] no onboarding-confirmation wiring here (implemented separately by TASK-20260711-003)

### TASK-20260711-003 — Persist confirmed onboarding CV and hydrate extracted fields

Status: done (merged as #975; authenticated production smoke owner-confirmed PASS 2026-07-11)
Owner: Claude / owner authenticated smoke
Branch: merged as `241b85d…`
Issue/PR: #963 / #975

#### Objective

Wire the final onboarding confirmation to the canonical persistence path **after** the exact
dedupe/idempotency foundation (#960) exists: the confirmed onboarding CV persists to My Files
and extracted years / current role / target roles hydrate into the profile. This is what lifts
onboarding out of PARTIAL.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] onboarding confirmation persists the CV via the canonical path (built on #960)
- [x] extracted years/current-role/target-roles require durable Neon persistence; failures return non-2xx and retry is idempotent
- [x] final-submit persistence + logout→login completion smoke pass with a verified account (owner-confirmed 2026-07-11)
- [x] owner production smoke → onboarding status lifted PARTIAL → VERIFIED

### TASK-20260711-004 — Consume validated login return path (`next`)

Status: done (merged as #981; CI green, Vercel READY)
Owner: Claude
Branch: merged as `c7aea42…`
Issue/PR: #962 / #981

#### Objective

Independent auth-UX follow-up: make the login success handler safely consume the validated
`?next=<path>` return path (surfaced by the #958 guard, which sets `next` but the login flow
does not yet honor it). **Not part of the onboarding persistence work** — a separate later
increment under the current priority order.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] login honors a validated internal `next` (rejects external/`//`/non-`/` per
  `lib/redirect.ts::resolveNextPath`) and returns the guest to the original page
- [x] no open-redirect; no change to onboarding-status-based routing when `next` is absent

#### Verification

- vitest `login-onboarding-routing.test.tsx`: 7 passed (valid `next` honored, open-redirect
  ignored, onboarding-priority preserved for incomplete users)
- `npm run build` green; CI green (pytest/frontend/Playwright/Postgres); Vercel READY

### TASK-20260711-006 — Subscription gating identity-key invariant + audit follow-ups

Status: partial (test locked via #982; two follow-ups open for owner triage)
Owner: Claude / owner triage
Branch: merged as `60978ae…`
Issue/PR: #982

#### Objective

Harden the per-account subscription/plan gating surfaced by an owner question ("is plan
activation per account, per package?"). Confirmed: gating is per-account, package-driven,
active-and-not-expired gated, and not special-cased per account.

#### Done

- [x] Locked the identity-key invariant with tests: plan gating must key on the account email
  (`resolve_effective_user_plan` looks up by the stored email verbatim; a non-email identity
  silently degrades to FREE). Invariant holds at all current authenticated call sites.

#### Open follow-ups (each its own scoped PR when picked up)

- [ ] Per-user entitlement override columns (`monthly_ai_message_limit`, …) are read by
  `get_subscription`/`upsert_subscription` but **ignored** by `resolve_effective_user_plan`
  (documented as reserved). Either apply them or remove them to avoid a silent trap.
- [ ] `count_saved_jobs` fallback counts rows with no `user_id` toward a specific user's quota
  (data-isolation smell; only triggers when the primary repo read fails).

### TASK-20260710-006 — P2: frontend build gate + frontend test visibility baseline (Phase 3 gate)

Status: done (completed by TASK-20260710-008 B1–B5)
Owner: Claude / owner sign-off on B3/B4
Branch: merged follow-up sequence
Issue/PR: follow-up to #942; see TASK-20260710-008

#### Objective

19 pre-existing vitest failures across 9 files sit in exactly the surfaces Phase 3 reskins
(signup/auth/chat/landing/profile/signals). PR #942 fixed the shared `next/navigation`/
`LanguageProvider` test-crash class (test-config only, no component changes): baseline
went from 302 passed/19 failed to 309 passed/12 failed. The residual sequence in
TASK-20260710-008 then reached 320/0 and promoted both `npm run build` and `npm run test`
(Vitest) to required CI gates.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Shared `next/navigation`/`LanguageProvider` test-crash class fixed via test-config
      only — no `apps/web` component/runtime changes (verified: diff is
      `vitest.setup.ts` + 2 test files + CI workflow + docs only).
- [x] `npm run build` wired into CI as a required, currently-green gate.
- [x] `npm run test` (vitest) promoted from informational to a required/blocking gate via
      TASK-20260710-008 B1–B5.

### TASK-20260710-007 — P2: authenticated production smoke path for agent sessions (Phase 3 gate)

Status: proposed (audit 2026-07-10; **blocks Phase 3** together with -006)
Owner: Roben (decision) + Claude (documentation)
Branch: n/a (process/credential task, not a code PR)
Issue/PR: none yet

#### Objective

Agent sessions have no approved smoke credentials, so login → `/me` → profile/settings →
authenticated `/command` (incl. auth-flash and "Sign in while logged in" checks) cannot be
verified without the owner. Owner decides: (a) provision a synthetic smoke account and
expose its credentials to agent sessions as env/secrets (never in repo), or (b) owner runs
the documented auth smoke per release. Document the chosen path in OPERATING_RULES.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Auth smoke runnable (by agent or documented owner procedure) before the Phase 3
      auth-shell PR merges.
- [ ] No credentials in repo/docs; synthetic account only; never a real user account.

### TASK-20260710-008 — Resolve residual frontend test failures before making vitest blocking

Status: done (B1–B5 all merged; suite 320/0 stable; vitest is now a required CI gate)
Owner: Claude (with owner sign-off on the B3/B4 YELLOW decisions)
Branch: `claude/career-terminology-audit-ojq1xl` (all five PRs)
Issue/PR: follow-up to #942; B1+B2 `test(frontend): resolve green residual vitest failures`,
B3 `fix(frontend): align chat action disabled reasons`, B4 `test(frontend): align sidebar routing
with current IA`, B5 `ci(frontend): make vitest a blocking gate`

#### Objective

`npm run test` (vitest) is wired into CI as informational-only (`continue-on-error: true`) after
PR #942 because residual tests still fail on clean `main`. This task tracks resolving them so
`npm run test` can be promoted to a required/blocking CI gate (the actual completion of
TASK-20260710-006). See `AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-07-10-fe-test-health-ci-gate.md` and
`AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-07-10-fe-green-residual-fixes.md` for full detail.

#### RESOLVED — PR B1+B2 (GREEN, test-only, merged/queued via `test(frontend): resolve green residual vitest failures`)

Baseline moved 309/12 → 317/4. All fixes were test-only (no product code):

- [x] `signup-auth-edge-cases.test.tsx` (2) — fixture bug: the 400/422 cases passed a non-empty
      `ApiError` message, so `mapSignupError`'s `err.message || checkDetails` rendered the message
      verbatim and never reached the generic fallback the test asserts. Fixed by using an empty
      backend message.
- [x] `command-auth-state.test.tsx` (2) — stale copy: the logout affordance is an accessible
      control labelled "Log out" (sidebar avatar button + mobile drawer item), never visible
      "Sign out" text. Updated assertions to query the `button` by accessible name `/log out/i`.
- [x] `landing-page.test.tsx` (1) — the whole hero/section copy block predated the landing
      rebuild; rewrote the copy assertions to match current shipped strings.
- [x] `chat-confirm-profile.test.tsx` (2) — race: `handleCVUpload` silently drops files while
      `chatAudience === "checking"`; the test uploaded before the mocked `/me` resolved. Added a
      wait for the public state ("Sign up free") before uploading.
- [x] `profile-name-edit.test.tsx` (1) — three coupled test-fixture issues: (a) the edit field
      seeds its draft from the current name so `userEvent.type` appended → added `user.clear()`;
      (b) `fetchProfile` has an extra caller (`useSidebarStatus` readiness hook) so the positional
      `mockResolvedValueOnce` chain mis-assigned values and the exact `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2)`
      was wrong → switched to a state-based mock (name flips after `updateProfile`) and a
      before/after-save delta assertion; (c) the saved name renders in two surfaces →
      `findAllByText`.

#### RESOLVED — PR B3 (owner-approved YELLOW, merged via `fix(frontend): align chat action disabled reasons`)

Baseline moved 317/4 → 320/1. One scoped product-code touch (`ChatActionCard.tsx`) + one test update:

- [x] `chat-action-card.test.tsx` (3) — added an explicit `open_drawer → "Coming soon"` branch to
      `disabledReason()` (product), kept the `submit`-no-endpoint message
      `"No endpoint configured for this action"` as-is, and updated that test's expectation to the
      current (more useful) message. No other component behavior changed.

#### RESOLVED — PR B4 (owner-approved YELLOW, merged via `test(frontend): align sidebar routing with current IA`)

Owner decision: the `/queue` ("Applications") sidebar nav removal is **intentional** — do not restore
it; keep the `/queue` page itself untouched. Suite is now **320/0** (total dropped from 321 because
the obsolete nav-item test was removed, not "fixed"):

- [x] `sidebar-nav-routing.test.ts` — removed the obsolete `applications`/`/queue` nav-item lookup and
      its routing test (there is no longer a `/queue` sidebar nav item to assert a contract for). The
      `/queue` route is kept as a valid *origin* pathname in the other cases since the page still
      exists.
- [x] `AppSidebar.tsx` — removed the orphaned `NAV_ITEM_KEYS["/queue"]` entry (verified dead: both
      `NAV_ITEM_KEYS[item.href]` lookups run only over `mainNavSections`, which no longer contains a
      `/queue` item). No sidebar UX/rendering change.

#### RESOLVED — PR B5 (Autonomous GREEN, merged via `ci(frontend): make vitest a blocking gate`)

Fixed the pre-existing `scrollTo` full-suite flake and promoted vitest to a required CI gate:

- [x] `vitest.setup.ts` — added `HTMLElement.prototype.scrollTo` + `window.scrollTo` mocks (jsdom
      implements neither). The command page's `scrollMessagesPane` no longer throws inside a
      requestAnimationFrame callback, which was the cross-file flake source. Stability proven by 6
      consecutive clean full-suite runs (320/0 each).
- [x] `.github/workflows/qa-tests.yml` — removed `continue-on-error: true` from the frontend `Vitest`
      step; it is now a required/blocking gate alongside `npm run build`. `pytest`/`playwright`
      unchanged.

#### Status: DONE — frontend test-health arc complete

`309/12 → 317/4 (B1+B2) → 320/1 (B3) → 320/0 (B4) → 320/0 stable + vitest blocking (B5)`.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: backend/API, auth/session internals, billing, schema/migrations, dependencies,
  AI provider/prompt/routing, #920.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] The 8 clearly test-only failures resolved without touching product code (PR B1+B2).
- [x] B3 (`chat-action-card`) resolved with owner sign-off (scoped product touch).
- [x] B4 (`sidebar-nav-routing`) resolved with owner sign-off (obsolete test + orphaned metadata
      removed; `/queue` nav stays removed, `/queue` page untouched).
- [x] B5: fixed the `scrollTo` full-suite flake in `vitest.setup.ts`, then promoted `npm run test`
      from informational (`continue-on-error: true`) to a required, green CI gate. Suite is 320/0,
      stable across 6 consecutive runs.

### TASK-20260710-002 — #929 `/design-preview` consolidation hub (one preview entry point)

Status: done (merged + production verified)
Owner: Claude
Branch: `feat/design-preview-hub` (merged, squash `9d47711`); docs sync on `claude/design-preview-hub-6o2ev5`
Issue/PR: #929 (merged)

#### Objective

Owner asked for one internal preview URL to review the whole Rico Atelier direction at once
instead of piece by piece. Shipped `/design-preview`: a noindex hub with a sticky
INTERNAL PREVIEW · SAMPLE DATA · ACTIONS DISABLED header, quick-jump nav, and six grouped
sections — live tiles (`/rico-preview`, `/design-gallery`, `/privacy`, `/refund-policy`,
terms) plus 53 labelled reference screenshots (EN/AR, desktop/mobile) covering landing,
auth, onboarding, authenticated workspace, support/legal, and
empty/loading/error/mobile/RTL states.

#### Continuity Block

- Scope: `apps/web/app/design-preview/{page,_client}.tsx` (new), 53 PNGs in
  `apps/web/public/design-preview/`, near-bottom-aware auto-follow in
  `apps/web/components/design-gallery/atelier-console/RicoConsole.tsx` (preview-only
  component). 56 files, +470/−1, one commit.
- Risk: low — additive noindex route + labelled static assets (~5.9 MB in `public/`) +
  contained scroll tweak. No production route/nav change; no backend/auth/billing/Neon/
  schema change; no new deps; no shadcn.
- Validation run: CI green on head `2fc729c` (pytest, playwright, Vercel deploy). The 19
  failing frontend tests are pre-existing `next/navigation` mock issues, confirmed
  identical on clean `main`. Post-merge production smoke PASS: `/design-preview`,
  `/rico-preview`, `/design-gallery`, `/privacy`, `/refund-policy`, landing all 200 on
  ricohunt.com.
- Rollback: revert #929 (squash `9d47711`) and let Vercel redeploy.

#### Merge provenance

Owner approved the draft merge in-chat; PR marked ready then squash-merged.

#### Next (owner-gated)

- Follow-up preview-only PRs by route group to turn the reference surfaces (landing, auth,
  onboarding, dashboard/profile/settings/applications/upload/pricing, support) into live
  interactive previews (shadcn-free rewrites of the Lovable screens).
- Any real `/command` production migration needs its own DEC + approved PR
  (`DEC-20260709-006`).

### TASK-20260710-001 — #908 RC1/RC4 fixes + Atelier Console direction (gallery, DEC, /rico-preview)

Status: done
Owner: Claude
Branch: multiple (all merged); docs sync on `docs/workspace-sync-2026-07-10`
Issue/PR: #914, #916, #921, #919, #924, #925, #926 (merged); #918 (closed); #920 (opened); #908 (closed)

#### Objective

Land the approved #908 attachment/Active-CV fixes, then explore the Atelier Console
as the candidate authenticated-workspace direction behind reference/preview surfaces —
without any production replacement or real actions.

#### What shipped (all owner-approved, merged unless noted)

- #914 — #908 RC1: widen attachment-follow-up regex → transcript-grounded handler.
- #916 — #908 RC4: prevent non-CV documents becoming the Active CV (`/upload-cv` +
  `/confirm-cv-profile`). Both RC1+RC4 confirmed by owner-run production smoke; **#908 closed**.
  RC2 (confidence wording) + RC3 (rejection taxonomy) deferred as separate items.
- #922/#923 — activation analytics (owner-authored); **production verified PASS** via a
  `weekly-admin-digest` `dry_run=true` Actions run (migration 036 applied; no email sent).
- #924 — Atelier Console isolated `/design-gallery` reference tab (Lovable "Atelier" port;
  light/dark, EN/AR, RTL, mobile; demo-only; actions reference-only; +lucide-react +3 fonts).
- #925 — `DEC-20260709-006`: Atelier Console = candidate workspace direction (preview only);
  amends `DEC-20260708-003` for exploration only. Nocturne stays production.
- #926 — internal `/rico-preview` route (noindex, reference-only) reusing the #924 console.
- #919 — dashboard-deploy CI fix (pull before regenerating `docs/index.html`).
- #921 — C2 privacy/refund handoff reclassified (stale brief rejected; ref zip → reviewed).
- #918 closed (command-concept gallery tab; superseded by #924; reviewed ref preserved).
- #920 opened — legal-review question for the shipped `/privacy` & `/refund-policy` copy.

#### Scope guardrails honored

- No production route/nav change; `/command`, `/rico`, `/` untouched. No real chat/job/apply/
  save/CV actions. No backend/auth/billing/Neon/schema change in the frontend/docs PRs.
- Not started: #917, #899, #872, #873, Phase 3, any production migration off Nocturne.

#### Next (owner-gated)

- Answer #920 (legal review of live privacy/refund copy).
- Any `/rico-preview` → production migration needs its own DEC + approved PR.

### TASK-20260709-004 — Sync #906/#907 merges + triage #908/#909

Status: done (docs-only sync/triage)
Owner: Claude
Branch: docs/908-909-triage-and-906-907-sync
Issue/PR: #906 (merged), #907 (merged), #908 (triage only), #909 (triage only)

#### Objective

Record that #906 (`profile_repo.py` connection-leak fix) and #907 (#758 job-key unification) are
merged and live (`main` at `ec06ef5`), and triage two new issues opened after the last
board-health scan: #908 (attachment-first orchestration bug, owner-flagged High) and #909
(governance-doc request, owner-flagged High).

#### Context

- Relevant files: none changed besides `AI_WORKSPACE/*`
- Relevant docs: `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-board-health-scan.md` (last full scan, 34 issues, predates
  #908/#909), `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-906-907-sync-and-908-909-triage.md` (full triage detail)

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: runtime code, tests, Neon, Vercel/Render config, issue labels/state, any
  `GOVERNANCE/` files
- No migrations
- Keep scope limited to: `AI_WORKSPACE/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, this file, the new handoff,
  `AI_WORKSPACE/MASTER_INDEX.md`

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] #906/#907 merge state and production-READY status recorded in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- [x] #908 triaged: owner's own comments quoted verbatim (orchestration root-cause, not symptom
      patches); flagged as needing owner sign-off before a deep-dive is launched
- [x] #909 triaged: conflict with existing governance docs and the PR #901 precedent flagged;
      no `GOVERNANCE/` file created

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260709-004
- GitHub issue/PR: #906 (merged), #907 (merged), #908 (triage only), #909 (triage only)
- Branch: docs/908-909-triage-and-906-907-sync
- Base branch: main
- Last safe commit SHA: ec06ef54d45f6ba81d7ee764e55a1bf8ffa94081
- Current head SHA: (this docs commit, no runtime change)
- Status: done
- Files changed: `AI_WORKSPACE/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, this file,
  `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-906-907-sync-and-908-909-triage.md`, `AI_WORKSPACE/MASTER_INDEX.md`
- Files intentionally not touched: all runtime code, tests, Neon, Vercel/Render config, issue
  labels/state, any `GOVERNANCE/` files
- What is complete: sync + triage, both new issues read in full including #908's 2 owner comments
- What is incomplete: #908 orchestration deep-dive (not started, awaiting scope/cost approval);
  #909 governance decision (not started, awaiting owner direction)
- Known blockers: owner decision needed on both #908 scope and #909 reuse-vs-new
- Validation already run: `git log origin/main` (`ec06ef5` HEAD confirmed); `list_issues` +
  `issue_read` (34 → 36 open issues, #908/#909 confirmed new)
- Validation still required: none for this docs-only sync
- Next exact action: #812 proceeds per prior explicit approval (separate task); #908/#909 wait for
  owner direction
- Stop condition: do not start #908's investigation or write any `GOVERNANCE/` file without
  explicit owner approval
- Rollback plan: revert this docs-only PR; no schema/env/runtime changes

### TASK-20260709-003 — #446 Stage 1 data-integrity cleanup

Status: done (Stage 1 only — Stage 2 deferred, #446 stays open)
Owner: Roben (execution via a Neon-connector session) / Claude (precheck, documentation)
Branch: docs/446-stage1-cleanup (docs-only persistence PR)
Issue/PR: #446 (Stage 1 of 2)

#### Objective

Clean up the 16 `public:web-*` `rico_users` rows that were corrupted by the old `ON CONFLICT`
bug (root cause fixed in #445), without touching the 5 non-public rows sharing the same email —
those need separate review (Stage 2).

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260709-003
- GitHub issue/PR: #446 (Stage 1 of 2; issue not closed)
- Branch: none for the cleanup itself (executed via a session with live Neon connector access,
  not a git branch); this entry is persisted via `docs/446-stage1-cleanup`
- Base branch: main
- Last safe commit SHA: b9563a78154743d0270586ce23326bc372be6192
- Current head SHA: b9563a78154743d0270586ce23326bc372be6192 (this task made no code commits)
- Status: done (Stage 1 only)
- Files changed: none by the cleanup itself; this docs-only PR changes `PROJECT_STATUS.md`,
  `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-446-stage1-cleanup.md`, `MASTER_INDEX.md`
- Files intentionally not touched: all runtime code, tests, schema, Vercel/Render config, issue
  labels/state; the 5 non-public `rico_users` rows (Stage 2, deferred)
- What is complete: Stage 1 precheck (fresh capture confirmed 16 target rows, primary excluded),
  Stage 1 `UPDATE` executed and committed, full post-cleanup validation passed
- What is incomplete: Stage 2 (5 non-public rows, including the primary) — not started, needs a
  separate review/decision before any mutation; #446 issue itself not yet updated/closed on GitHub
- Known blockers: none for Stage 1; Stage 2 requires manual inspection of 5 rows' `external_user_id`/
  `source`/`created_at` and cross-reference against Jotform/Telegram history before any decision
- Validation already run (via the Neon-connector session, not this session):
  before-count = 21 → capture confirmed 16 → primary-in-target-set = 0 → `UPDATE` on the 16
  explicit IDs → after-count = 5 → 16/16 target IDs confirmed `email IS NULL` → primary confirmed
  still `email = 'robenedwan@gmail.com'` → 0 orphaned `rico_chat_history` rows
- Validation still required: none for Stage 1 (complete); Stage 2 validation TBD once scoped
- Next exact action: Stage 2 review of the 5 non-public rows (separate task, no mutation without
  a fresh decision); independently, fix `profile_repo.py` connection leak → #758 → #812
- Stop condition: do not run any further Neon mutation without a new explicit owner approval
  scoped to that specific change; do not close #446 until Stage 2 is resolved or the issue is
  updated to reflect partial completion
- Rollback plan: `UPDATE rico_users SET email = 'robenedwan@gmail.com' WHERE id IN (<the 16
  manifest IDs>);` — full manifest and ready-to-run SQL in
  `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-446-stage1-cleanup.md`

manifest, before/after counts, and validation detail.

### TASK-20260709-002 — Security/data-risk deep dive on #127 and #198 (read-only)

Status: done
Owner: Roben / Claude
Branch: docs/security-data-risk-deep-dive (docs-only persistence PR)
Issue/PR: #127, #198 (read-only code-inspection deep dive; #263 deferred, not checked)

#### Objective

Verify, by direct code inspection against current `main`, whether the security/data-risk claims
in #127 and #198 (flagged "needs full deep dive" by the 2026-07-09 board-health scan) are still

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260709-002
- GitHub issue/PR: #127, #198 (read-only; #263 deferred)

- Current head SHA: d2bd86093a155b91522c4cb02e9cd6db23b498d2 (deep dive made no code commits)
- Status: done
- Files changed: none during the deep dive; this docs-only PR changes `PROJECT_STATUS.md`,
  `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-security-data-risk-deep-dive.md`,
  `MASTER_INDEX.md`
- Files intentionally not touched: all runtime code (read-only inspection only — `src/rico_db.py`,
  `src/repositories/subscription_repo.py`, `src/repositories/profile_repo.py`,
  `src/repositories/applications_repo.py`, `src/indeed_apply.py`, `src/run_daily.py`, `src/db.py`,

  were all read, none edited), tests, Neon, Vercel/Render config, issue labels/state
- What is complete: every named claim in #127 and #198 checked against current code (see handoff
  for the full per-claim table); no Codex/automated review was run — this was direct manual
  inspection only, and is not represented as a Codex-reviewed result
- What is incomplete: #263 (product-behavior contradiction claims) not yet checked — deferred per
  time constraints, same as the original scan noted; several lower-severity #198 findings (C3, C4,
  H1, H2, H4, M1–M7, L1–L4) not checked
- Known blockers: none
- Validation already run: `grep`/`Read` inspection of the specific files/functions named in each
  claim; cross-checked `profile_repo.py` call sites against the leak pattern documented in
  `rico_db.py`'s own code comment
- Validation still required: #263 deep dive (if picked up); the lower-severity #198 items listed
  above
- Next exact action: #446 read-only Neon precheck (count/identify affected rows, confirm #445
  root cause still holds, prepare transaction + rollback SQL) — no cleanup execution without
  explicit owner approval
- Stop condition: do not execute the #446 cleanup, or start #758/#812, or fix the `profile_repo.py`
  leak, until the owner has reviewed the precheck result and explicitly approves each next step
- Rollback plan: revert this docs-only PR; no schema/env/runtime changes, isolated to the 5
  workspace files above

### TASK-20260709-001 — Board-health scan (read-only)

Status: done
Owner: Roben / Claude
Branch: docs/board-health-scan-sync (docs-only state-sync PR)
Issue/PR: none (read-only board scan); persisted via this docs-only PR

#### Objective

Classify all 34 open GitHub issues (P0/P1/P2/P3/close-candidate/needs-deep-dive) using the
newly-active Rico Continuity Gate, so the next work item is chosen from evidence, not guesswork.

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260709-001
- GitHub issue/PR: none (read-only board scan)
- Branch: none during the scan itself (no branch created — read-only); this entry is persisted
  via `docs/board-health-scan-sync`
- Base branch: main
- Last safe commit SHA: f6996b4da04f6d3812fe873067e89247c8bb165e

  `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-board-health-scan.md`, `MASTER_INDEX.md`
- Files intentionally not touched: all runtime code, tests, Neon, Vercel/Render config, issue
  labels/state
- What is complete: full metadata scan of all 34 open issues; full-body read + classification of
  18 issues matching risk trigger categories, plus #446 per explicit instruction; report delivered
- What is incomplete: #127, #198, #263 flagged "needs full deep dive" — classification pending
  actual code verification against current `main`, not resolved by this scan
- Known blockers: none
- Validation already run: `list_pull_requests` (4 open, all previously triaged),
  `search_issues`/`list_issues` cross-check (34 open, consistent counts across both calls)
- Validation still required: code-level verification for #127 (SQL injection claim in
  `src/rico_db.py#get_recommendations`), #198 (connection-leak claims in `rico_db.py`/
  `subscription_repo.py`, public-chat identity gap in `src/api/routers/rico_chat.py`), #263
  (product-behavior contradiction claims — check against #892/#747 fixes)
- Next exact action: security/data-risk deep dive on #127 and #198 (then #263 if time remains),
  per `HANDOFFS/2026-07-09-board-health-scan.md`; if live issues confirmed, fix those first; if
  stale/fixed, proceed to #446 (owner-gated cleanup) → #758 → #812
- Stop condition: do not start #758/#812/#446 until #127/#198 deep-dive verification is reported
  and the owner confirms priority; stop and report if deep dive finds a live, unpatched security
  issue rather than silently fixing it
- Rollback plan: revert this docs-only PR; no schema/env/runtime changes, isolated to the 5
  workspace files listed above

### TASK-20260708-001 — Phase 3 chat integration: follow-up readiness query (first slice)

Status: done (merged #891 → `80e246b`; deploy verification pending — Render egress blocked from the working session)
Owner: Roben / Claude
Branch: feat/chat-followup-readiness (merged, squash `80e246b`)
Issue/PR: #891 — Engineering Roadmap Phase 3 (Chat Integration)

#### Objective

Let chat answer "what should I follow up?" / "which jobs are due for follow-up?" (EN + AR) by
reusing the merged #885 readiness logic (`get_by_status("applied")` → `select_revisit_candidates`,
the same reads behind `GET /api/v1/jobs/lifecycle/follow-ups`). No new lifecycle logic.

#### Scope

- Add `_FOLLOWUP_READINESS_RE` + `_handle_followup_readiness` in `src/rico_chat_api.py`; dispatch
  before `_FOLLOWUP_TIMING_RE` so timing questions are untouched.
- Out of scope: unifying `applications_repo` vs `user_job_context`; notifications; scheduler;
  migrations; UI; changes to "show my applications" / "opened but not applied" / timing advice.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Follow-up readiness query routes to lifecycle readiness, not job_search or timing.
- [x] Empty state is safe (no fake success), EN + AR.
- [x] Existing lifecycle/timing/applications routes unchanged (regex non-hijack tests + 1264-test regression green).
- [x] `tests/unit/test_chat_followup_readiness.py` passes.

#### Follow-up

- [ ] Phase 4 / DEC-PR-B: reconcile the two application stores (`applications_repo` vs
      `user_job_context`) — deliberately out of this slice.

### TASK-20260707-001 — Phased architecture maturation roadmap (state-first, then migration/redesign)

Status: scoped (roadmap; each phase becomes its own scoped task + PR)
Owner: Roben / Claude
Branch: per-phase (this entry is the roadmap, not a single PR)
Issue/PR: DECISIONS.md → DEC-20260707-001

#### Objective

Mature Rico from a mixed-responsibility backend into a clean API + worker split with Neon as the
single source of truth, in ordered phases. Fix operational state (Rico must never forget what it
found, what the user opened, what was applied, and what needs follow-up) **before** any platform
migration or UI redesign.

#### Context

- Relevant docs: `AI_WORKSPACE/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Target architecture section), DEC-20260707-001,
  and the near-term execution gate `AI_WORKSPACE/AUDITS/2026-07-08-production-hardening-audit.md`
  (+ Codex follow-up). Read the audit before starting any feature/redesign/worker/infra work.
- Existing behavior: FastAPI on Render mixes request handling, temporary chat memory, and the
  job-search script; apply links / job context historically unreliable on Render's ephemeral disk.
- PR A persistence already exists on `main` (`user_job_context_repo.py`, migrations 018–022,
  `rico_chat_api.py` write/read paths, lifecycle routers) — so PR A is verify-first, not rebuild.

#### Constraints

- DEC-20260707-001 is the architecture-level roadmap; the 2026-07-08 production hardening audit is
  the near-term execution gate that controls immediate stabilization work.
- Smallest-safe-first; one phase per PR from current `main`.
- Do not start the UI redesign or the Render→Railway move until phases 1–4 land; Render stays the
  current production backend.
- Verify-first: fix only gaps proven via the audit's checks. No second implementation of job
  persistence.
- Verification/fixes use synthetic users and synthetic profile data only; no real-user smoke or
  mutation unless the owner explicitly approves a specific smoke run.
- Fixes must be global and user-agnostic (Product Generalization Rule), not per-account.

#### Phase order (each becomes its own scoped task; per-phase success criteria in DEC-20260707-001)

- [ ] Phase 1 (PR A, verify-first) — Persist job context + apply links (top-priority reliability fix;
      prove Audit Phase 2 gaps with synthetic data, fix only proven gaps, do not rebuild)
- [ ] Phase 2 (PR B) — Application lifecycle cleanup
- [ ] Phase 3 (PR C) — API / client consolidation
- [ ] Phase 4 (PR D) — Worker / cron separation
- [ ] Phase 5 (PR E) — Move backend from Render to Railway (Render stays production until Railway passes full smoke)
- [ ] Phase 6 (PR F) — Add monitoring / logging
- [ ] Phase 7 (PR G) — UI redesign (only after 1–6)

#### Required verification

- [ ] Per phase: focused unit tests + `apps/web` build where frontend changes; deploy smoke when
      runtime changes (per OPERATING_RULES.md).

### TASK-20260703-038 — Chat intent router over-triggers job_search (P0)

Status: proposed (verified 2026-07-04: TC-8 slice done; TC-11 + general fix still open)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: chat-QA 2026-07-03 (TC-8, TC-11; contributes TC-4/TC-5) — TC-8 landed via #834/#835

#### Objective

Stop the intent dispatcher in `src/rico_chat_api.py` from routing to `job_search` on the mere
presence of a company/role token. Verb/sentence structure must decide the intent
("prepare me for an interview …" → coaching, not search).

#### Context

- Relevant files: `src/rico_chat_api.py` (`classify_intent` + `legacy_intent` dispatch from ~L7485).
- Existing behavior: company/role keywords appear to force `job_search` regardless of verb.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] "prepare me for an interview for <role> at <company>" routes to interview/coaching, not
      search — `_INTERVIEW_REQUEST_RE` guard + `_resolve_interview_prep_target`
      (`rico_chat_api.py`); confirmed green 2026-07-04 via
      `tests/test_tc8_interview_prep_grounding.py` + `tests/test_tc2_tc8_wiring.py`.
- [ ] "what is my profile?" does not flash a search first (TC-11) — not verified; frontend
      heuristic in `apps/web/app/command/page.tsx` was being reproduced when last checked,
      no confirmed verdict either way. Still open.
- [ ] Explicit search verbs (search/find/ابحث) still route to search — not independently
      re-verified against the TC-8 change.
- [ ] Regression: existing intent tests (#814 suite) stay green.

### TASK-20260703-039 — Application tracking from plain text + OCR (P0)

Status: proposed (verified 2026-07-04: TC-6 applied-confirmation OCR path partial — not the general acceptance; TC-7 plain-text slice open)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: chat-QA 2026-07-03 (TC-7, TC-6) — TC-6 slice landed via #806/#807

#### Objective

Classify structured tracking text ("Position: X. Company: Y. Track it.") into the existing
`application_tracking` intent, and feed OCR-extracted entities into the tracking tool from
conversation context instead of re-running extraction.

#### Context

- `application_tracking` intent handler already exists (`rico_chat_api.py:4462`) — this is a
  classify/extract gap, NOT a missing feature. Do not build a parallel tracking path.
- OCR already extracts company/title (TC-6) but the tool call ignores it.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] "Position: X. Company: Y. Track it." saves to the pipeline without a UI button (TC-7) —
      not verified as of 2026-07-04; still open.
- [~] Screenshot OCR entities are consumed by the tracking call for the "applied" confirmation
      case (TC-6) — partially addressed by #806/#807 "use screenshot OCR text for applied
      reports despite failed classification". This proves ONLY the applied-confirmation OCR
      entity path, NOT the general "OCR entities consumed by the tracking call" acceptance.
      Partially addressed; needs broader verification/test beyond the applied-confirmation path.
- [ ] Idempotent save (respects the BUG-14 upsert arbiter) — not independently re-verified here.

### TASK-20260703-040 — Relevance scoring + nationality-gate filtering (P1)

Status: proposed (verified 2026-07-04: TC-2 done; TC-1 badge still open)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: chat-QA 2026-07-03 (TC-2, TC-1) — TC-2 landed via #834/#835/#844

#### Objective

Rank by function + seniority + skills overlap, not job-title keyword presence; flag/deprioritize
UAE-national-gated roles when the profile does not confirm eligibility.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] ESG/Compliance profile no longer surfaces software-engineering roles in top results (TC-2)
      — `relevance_floor` in `rico_chat_api.py` (~L5589); confirmed green 2026-07-04 via
      `tests/test_tc2_target_role_propagation.py` + `tests/test_search_title_relevance_floor.py`.
- [ ] "Priority for UAE nationals" roles carry a badge and drop out of top-ranked results unless
      eligibility is known (TC-1) — `is_uae_national` gate logic exists (`rico_chat_api.py:5424`)
      but no explicit badge/deprioritization confirmed. Still open.

### TASK-20260703-041 — Search session cache + dedup + render idempotency (P1)

Status: proposed (verified 2026-07-04: TC-3 render idempotency partial — diff-only, no test; TC-10 session cache still open)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: chat-QA 2026-07-03 (TC-10, TC-3) — TC-3 landed via #815

#### Objective

Cache search results per session/query, dedup against already-shown jobs, and add an idempotency
key on message render to kill the double-render risk.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Repeat "search again" does not return a fully disjoint set with no explanation (TC-10) —
      not implemented; existing dedup (`rico_chat_api.py:5460`) is scoped to a single search
      call, not cached/deduped across the session. Still open.
- [ ] Already-shown jobs are not re-shown as new within a session (TC-10, same gap as above).
- [~] Message render is idempotent (no duplicate render on stream completing twice) (TC-3) —
      abort button + request dedup + 45s hard-timeout, #815
      (`apps/web/app/command/page.tsx`). Partially addressed: supported by diff inspection of
      the merged frontend change, but there is NO automated test proving render idempotency on
      double stream-complete. Partially addressed; needs broader verification/test.

### TASK-20260703-042 — Per-message language detection (P1)

Status: proposed (re-verified 2026-07-04: genuinely open — no per-message override found;
`_is_arabic_text` runs per-message for deterministic routing, but the LLM/conversational path
has no `detect_language`/language-override mechanism)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: chat-QA 2026-07-03 (TC-9)

#### Objective

Detect language on the latest user message and reply in that language; add a persistent language
override in settings. Confirm this is not a regression from the #813 Arabic-guard move.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Switching to English mid-session gets English replies (TC-9).
- [ ] Arabic cold-start guard behavior (#813) is preserved.

### TASK-20260703-043 — Conversational UX gates (P2)

Status: proposed (re-verified 2026-07-04: genuinely open, no partial coverage found)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: chat-QA 2026-07-03 (TC-4, TC-5, TC-12)

#### Objective

Confirm active targets before the first search after a target update (TC-4); re-ask disambiguation
on a bare "search" when target ambiguity was raised (TC-5); make "what can you do?" onboarding-safe
for cold-start/first-message users while keeping contextual answers when session data exists (TC-12).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] First search after target update confirms the active targets.
- [ ] Bare "ابحث"/"search" re-triggers disambiguation when ambiguity is open.
- [ ] Cold-start "what can you do?" returns a structured capability overview.

### TASK-20260703-037 — Neon redundant-index cleanup (migrations 034 + 035)

Status: done
Owner: Claude (GitHub session)
Branch: claude/neon-db-index-cleanup-67ewh9
Issue/PR: #826 (034, merged), #828 (035, merged), #827 (closed dup)

#### Objective

Drop write-amplifying redundant duplicate/subset indexes on the Neon hot per-user
tables, and codify the covering full-UNIQUE that production carried but the repo
never created.

#### Outcome

- #826 merged: 034 drops 6 redundant indexes (each covered by a surviving index);
  `034` added to `_NO_OBJECT_MIGRATIONS`.
- #828 merged: 035 codifies `rico_job_recommendations_user_id_job_key_key`
  (idempotent) + adds a drift-check entry for it.
- Production apply owner-verified on Neon `production` branch: 0 redundant indexes
  remain (diff query); covering uniques present.
- Migration Drift Check workflow green on `b021273` (live DB has all signature
  objects incl. 035's constraint).
- Load-bearing indexes preserved: partial-unique arbiter (BUG-14),
  `idx_user_job_context_user_searched_at` (028 drift signature).

#### Follow-up

- [ ] Confirm any other Neon branch Render's `DATABASE_URL` may use also shows 0 rows.
- [ ] #712 005 remainder (keyword tables / view / enum / trigger) still to verify.

### TASK-20260703-036 — BUG-14: pipeline save idempotency (owner-gated migration)

Status: in_progress (migration 011 APPLIED 2026-07-03; only draft PR #784 + smoke remain)
Owner: a coder for #784 + owner authenticated smoke
Branch: — (PR #784)
Issue/PR: BUG-14; draft PR #784; migration drift #711

#### Objective

Make a second "save this job" a no-op (no counter increment) on both save paths.

#### Context

- Diagnosed 2026-07-03. The chat ordinal-save persists via
  `rico_db.upsert_recommendation`, whose `ON CONFLICT (user_id, job_key) WHERE job_key
  IS NOT NULL` requires the partial unique index from **migration 011**
  (`idx_rico_recommendations_user_job_unique`) — **APPLIED in production, owner-verified
  2026-07-03** via `pg_indexes`. So the chat ordinal-save path is now idempotent.
- The non-ordinal `jobs_service.save_job/skip/block` path dedups via the JSON-file
  `is_applied()`, which returns False for DB-backed SaaS users → duplicates. Fixed only
  in **draft PR #784** (`skip/save/block` → `applications_repo.find_by_job_id`), unmerged.
- Runbook for applying migration 011 safely (dedup DELETE + partial unique index):
  `docs/runbooks/production-drift-005-011.md` (Step A).

#### Constraints

- Migration is owner-gated and includes a destructive dedupe `DELETE` — apply only at the
  Neon console after the runbook's pre-checks. Sandbox cannot reach Neon.
- No new idempotency scheme; reuse the existing `save_key` / unique-index design.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Migration 011 applied to production Neon (unique index present) — verified 2026-07-03.
- [ ] PR #784 reviewed + merged (non-ordinal path uses `applications_repo`).
- [ ] Owner smoke: "save the second job" twice → count +1 then unchanged; repeat on the
      non-ordinal save path.

### TASK-20260702-035 — JobFromAttachmentService: first-class job entities from attachments

Status: proposed (owner architecture note, 2026-07-02)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: —
Issue/PR: follows merged PR #807 (`c7d8343`)

#### Objective

Replace the #807 heuristic fallback with a first-class service that turns any attachment
transcript into a job entity and links it to the user's pipeline. Owner-sketched design:
`JobFromAttachmentService(attachment_text, user_id)` → `extract_job_entities` (company,
title, location — NER or stronger regex) → fuzzy/trigram match against the user's existing
pipeline jobs → create a new `JobAd` (`source_type="screenshot"`) when no match → build a
`JobApplication` with `confidence_source="user_confirmed_from_screenshot"` on user
confirmation.

#### Context

- PR #807 shipped the interim behavior: `_applied_from_screenshot_fallback` +
  `_extract_job_entities_from_transcript` in `src/rico_chat_api.py` (heuristics; one-click
  confirm / disambiguation buttons; no pipeline matching, no new entities).
- Known limits of the interim fix this service should close: no fuzzy match against
  already-tracked jobs (can create near-duplicates), heuristic extraction (role-keyword
  lists), no `source_type` provenance on the created record beyond `source="chat"`.

#### Constraints

- Keep `src/rico_safety.py` guardrails and the mark-applied confirmation gate.
- No schema change without owner sign-off (JobAd/JobApplication entities imply migrations).
- False-positive guard: never create an application without explicit user confirmation.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Screenshot of an already-tracked job matches the existing pipeline row (no duplicate).
- [ ] Screenshot of a new job creates one record with screenshot provenance.
- [ ] Multi-job screenshot produces a disambiguation step (parity with #807).
- [ ] CV / identity transcripts never produce job entities.

### TASK-20260702-033 — Enable personalized job-alert emails (PR-3, owner-gated)

Status: in_progress (migration applied + plumbing smoke done; activation still owner-gated)
Owner: unassigned (owner-gated enable steps)
Branch: —
Issue/PR: follows merged PR #805 (`f64e7e0`)

#### Objective

Turn on the opt-in job-alert emails shipped inert in PR #805. No new feature code required to
start; this is the enable + harden pass.

#### Context

- Feature merged and gated/inert. See `CURRENT_STATE.md` → "Email job alerts — PR #805".
- Key files: `src/services/email_alert_service.py`, `src/services/email_notifications.py`,
  `migrations/033_email_job_alerts.sql`, `.github/workflows/job-alert-emails.yml`.

#### Enable steps (in order)

- [x] Apply `migrations/033` to Neon (done 2026-07-02; both tables + idx_eal_user_sent /
      idx_eut_token + primary/unique indexes verified).
- [x] Plumbing smoke: `POST /api/v1/pipeline/job-alert-emails?dry_run=true` (X-Cron-Secret) →
      `{status: ok, users: 0, sent: 0, dry_run: true}` (2026-07-02). Endpoint deployed + cron
      auth OK + dry-run bypasses kill-switch without sending. (Optional GitHub-workflow path
      still needs `RICO_API_URL` / `RICO_CRON_SECRET` repo secrets if run via CI instead.)
- [ ] Match-quality smoke: opt in one test/owner account (`POST /api/v1/settings/email/opt-in`),
      re-run the dry-run; expect `users:1` and non-zero would-send or a match-related skip reason.
- [ ] Set `RICO_ENABLE_EMAIL_ALERTS=true` on Render.
- [ ] Enable the daily `schedule:` in `job-alert-emails.yml`.
- [ ] Monitor `email_alert_log` for the first sends; verify unsubscribe link end-to-end.

#### Hardening (address before/with scale — review findings #3/#5)

- [ ] #3 — cron runs live JSearch per user sequentially in a sync request: move to async/batched
      or a queue so large opt-in volume doesn't time out or exhaust JSearch quota.
- [ ] #5 — dedup opens a new DB connection per candidate job: fetch the user's already-sent
      job_keys once per user instead of per-job.

#### Follow-on

- [ ] Arabic (RTL) email localization (English-only in MVP).

#### Rollback

Unset `RICO_ENABLE_EMAIL_ALERTS` (runtime off), disable the workflow schedule; migration 033 is
additive and code tolerates the tables being present.

### TASK-20260630-032 — Rico UX Improvements: Search & Intent Flow (engineering spec, owner-authored)

Status: proposed (tracking task — spin each item into its own TASK-NNN when picked up)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: —
Issue/PR: docs-only (this ledger entry)

#### Objective

Capture the owner's engineering spec for chat/intent-flow UX so it is not lost in chat
history. Source: owner review of the conversational search/recommendation flow, reframed as
a directly-implementable spec ("لكنني سأعيد صياغتها لتكون Engineering Spec قابلة للتنفيذ
مباشرة بدون إدخال حلول قد تقيد التصميم" — agree with most points, but reframed as an
implementable engineering spec without baking in solutions that would constrain design).
Priority: P1 (Core Conversation UX). No implementation in this entry — docs/ledger only.

#### Source

Owner-authored spec, pasted verbatim into this session on 2026-06-30, titled "Rico UX
Improvements — Search & Intent Flow." Touches `src/rico_chat_api.py` (intent classification /
role intelligence pipeline), `src/services/chat_service.py`, and the public/`/command` and
`/chat` frontends. Any implementation must continue to respect `src/rico_safety.py` guardrails
and `src/agent/runtime.py` approval-gating — interrupting a pending confirmation flow must
never be used to bypass an approval-gated action (e.g. apply).

#### Backlog (spec sections, in the owner's priority order)

1. **Interruptible Conversation Flow** — a newly detected high-confidence intent should
   interrupt a pending confirmation flow instead of Rico continuing to wait on the stale
   question. Interrupt only when: intent confidence is high, the new intent differs from the
   pending confirmation, and the request is executable immediately. Do NOT interrupt when the
   user is answering the pending question or genuine clarification is required.
   Example: Assistant asks "What sounds best to you?"; user says "Find me a job" — Rico should
   immediately start the job search ("Got it. I'll start searching for jobs that match your
   profile.") rather than re-asking the original question.
2. **Search-first Principle** — for "Find me a job" / "Find jobs from my CV" / "Search jobs",
   the primary goal is to search immediately and return results, then offer improvements —
   not to pause for configuration questions first unless search is genuinely impossible
   without them. Preferred flow: Search → Return results → Offer improvements (not the
   reverse).
3. **Internal Terms Must Never Reach Users** — internal state labels (`STALE`, `DIRTY`,
   `NEEDS_REFRESH`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE_ROLE`, etc.) must be translated into natural language
   before reaching user-facing text. E.g. not "Target roles are STALE" but "Your saved target
   roles no longer fully reflect your current experience."
4. **Recommendation Confidence** — role recommendations should surface a match percentage
   (e.g. ESG Manager 96%, Compliance Manager 94%, Operations Manager 93%, HSE Manager 92%)
   with a brief explanation of why each role is recommended.
5. **Preserve Valid Existing Roles** — do not reject a user's saved role outright just because
   stronger matches exist; grade existing + recommended roles together (✅ Strong match / ✅
   Moderate match / ❌ Weak match) instead of a categorical rejection like "Logistics doesn't
   fit." Prefer comparative phrasing: "Logistics-focused roles are a weaker match than
   Operations, ESG, Compliance, and HSE positions based on your experience."
6. **Immediate Actions** — after recommendations, present executable actions (e.g. "Search
   these roles now", "Update my saved target roles", "Compare current vs recommended roles",
   "Keep my current target roles") instead of another open-ended question; these actions
   should execute immediately when chosen.
7. **Long-running Search Experience** — searching should show an elapsed timer and progress
   updates, with a single retry if appropriate. Target max wait: 20s. If the search can't
   complete in time, return partial results when possible; otherwise explain clearly
   (provider unavailable / timeout / retry available) rather than leaving the user waiting
   indefinitely.
8. **Preserve User Intent** — the user's original request must complete before optional
   improvements are offered. E.g. for "Find jobs from my CV": (1) search jobs, (2) return
   results, (3) suggest role improvements, (4) offer to save new target roles — never reverse
   this order.

#### Owner's overall assessment (verbatim)

"The current implementation demonstrates good profile reasoning and CV understanding. The
biggest remaining UX gap is execution flow: Rico identifies improvements well, but it
sometimes pauses for confirmation instead of completing the task the user explicitly
requested. Prioritizing task completion first, followed by optional optimization, will make
the assistant feel significantly more responsive and aligned with user intent."

#### Constraints

- Docs/ledger only in this entry — no code changes.
- Each numbered item becomes its own scoped TASK-NNN + branch when implemented. Do not start
  without explicit scope/branch assignment.
- Implementation must not weaken `src/rico_safety.py` guardrails or
  `RICO_REQUIRE_APPROVAL_FOR_APPLICATIONS` — "interruptible flow" (item 1) is about routing a
  new intent, not about skipping approval gates for high-impact actions.

#### Notes

- Logged per explicit owner instruction ("note the following as we need to work on it as
  well") on 2026-06-30, immediately after BUG-2/BUG-3/BUG-6 closure. Not yet prioritized
  against BUG-7/BUG-9/BUG-10/BUG-11.

### TASK-20260622-031 — PR C: strongest CV/profile selection + session-context retention

Status: done (merged as PR #801 `b94ec1f` on 2026-07-01, deployed; branch deleted)
Owner: Claude
Branch: `fix/profile-context-role-selection` (merged + deleted)
Issue/PR: PR #801

#### Objective

Fix the remaining production Tests 1 and 7 after the job-flow stabilization train (#727/#724/#723/#728/#729/#730).

#### Test 1 — ✅ fixed (pending PR/merge)

Prompt: `Find UAE jobs that match my strongest CV profile.`

Expected:

- Do not blindly use stale `target_role` such as Software Engineer.
- Use the strongest confirmed active CV/profile signal.
- If multiple profile tracks exist and confidence is ambiguous, ask the user to choose.
- Do not silently choose stale or irrelevant target_role.

Fix: search-first behavior in `job_search_profile_match` and the location-guard path of
`_classified_role_search` (`src/rico_chat_api.py`) — when a saved role is stale but the CV
yields a clear single-family suggestion list, search the top CV-evidenced role immediately
with an explanatory note instead of pausing to ask. Falls back to ask-to-choose when CV
suggestions are empty or span 2+ families. Commit `48e9cba` on `fix/profile-context-role-selection`.

#### Test 7 — ✅ fixed, already on `main`

Prompt: `Search UAE jobs for Environmental Manager.`

Expected:

- Do not silently substitute Environmental Manager with Environmental Officer.
- If exact role is unavailable, ask permission before broadening.
- Preserve authenticated user/CV/session context.
- Do not ask a logged-in Pro user with uploaded CV to sign up or upload again.
- Keep location UAE-focused with safe preference for UAE/Ajman/Dubai/Sharjah/Abu Dhabi.

Fix landed directly on `main` at `bd4c4f8` ("honor verbatim role text in classified role
search") — `_classified_role_search`'s `profile_relevant` branch now passes `role_text.strip()`
instead of the taxonomy canonical alias.

#### Constraints

- No auth rewrite.
- No billing changes.
- No DB migration.
- No #712 work.
- No landing-page work.
- No provider scraping.
- No repeated real provider searches.
- Use mocks/fixtures only in tests.
- Keep `src/services/job_link.py` as the only canonical resolver.
- Do not reintroduce `src/rico_link_resolver.py`.
- Do not touch unrelated chat flows.

#### Required process

- [x] Start from clean current `origin/main`.
- [x] Read-only map current CV/profile selection flow.
- [x] Read-only map where `target_role` is loaded.
- [x] Read-only map where auth/CV context is lost.
- [x] Read-only map where role substitution happens.
- [x] Report the smallest safe implementation plan before large edits.
- [x] Add regression tests for T1 and T7.
- [x] Open PR (merged as #801).
- [x] Run focused tests and related chat/profile tests — 27/27 in
      `tests/unit/test_profile_context_role_selection.py`; 143/143 across
      `test_bug17_pipeline_reset.py`, `test_bug12_arabic_search_locale.py`,
      `test_arabic_context_retention.py`, `test_apply_tracking_and_freshness.py`,
      `test_manual_application_tracking.py`, `test_lifecycle_followup.py`,
      `test_application_tracking_intelligence.py`, `test_p0_trust_fixes.py`.
- [x] Merge only if CI is green and scope is clean (merged #801, CI green).
- [x] Verify `/version` and `/health` after deploy (verified through the #806/#807/#808
      deploy chain — production at `a2a53b4`, health ok, 2026-07-02).

#### Handoff notes

- Latest full handoff: `AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-06-22-job-flow-stabilization-complete.md`.
- Current production baseline before PR C: `38fbf5da19975df6f7d3d21168b137741d502e6d`.
- T1 fix source: an unmerged background session left the search-first behavior on
  `origin/claude/workflow-progress-check-qycxuo` (commit `52e44b8`) alongside T7 and TASK-030
  fixes that had already been hand-ported to `main` separately (`bd4c4f8`, `77563af`). Only the
  search-first hunks were hand-applied to `fix/profile-context-role-selection` — that branch
  also carried a stale `_build_tracking_message` hunk (pre-dating PR #797's opened/applied
  stage-count fix) which was intentionally NOT ported, since applying it would have regressed
  that fix. `claude/workflow-progress-check-qycxuo` has since been deleted as fully superseded.
- Rollback plan: revert the merge commit for `fix/profile-context-role-selection`; no
  schema/env changes, isolated to `src/rico_chat_api.py` chat-routing logic.
- Rollback plan: revert PR C only; no schema/env changes allowed.

### TASK-20260621-030 — CAREER-OS-04 remaining gap: inject uploaded document context into Rico AI prompt

Status: proposed
Owner: unassigned
Branch: —
Issue/PR: —

#### Objective

When a user uploads a non-CV document (offer letter, contract, cover letter, etc.) and then chats
about it, Rico currently has no access to the document type or content in its AI prompt. The upload
route now stores `last_uploaded_document` in `recent_context` (fixed in PR #717), but the chat
handler does not yet inject this into the AI system prompt or message context.

#### Existing behavior after PR #717

- Explicit meta-queries ("what did I upload?", "document type?") → answered from `recent_context`
  without an AI call via `_get_recent_upload_document_reply`.
- All other messages about the document (e.g. "can you review it?") → falls through to normal AI
  routing with no document context injected.

#### Required change

In `rico_chat_api.py` `_process_message_inner` or the AI context builder, check for
`last_uploaded_document` in `recent_context` and if the document is non-CV and recent (< 24h),
inject a brief note into the system prompt / user context:

```
[Uploaded document: {label} ({filename}) — confidence {pct}%]
```

This lets the AI model answer "can you review it?", "summarize this offer letter" etc. with
context about what was uploaded.

For non-trivial document types (offer_letter, contract, cover_letter), also check whether the
document content is available in the user's parsed files (via `user_documents` DB table) and
include a brief extract if available.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: the document classifier, the upload route, `_get_recent_upload_document_reply`
- No migrations required
- Must not break existing job-search or onboarding flows
- Add regression tests for the injection path

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] User uploads a cover letter → types "can you review my cover letter?" → Rico responds
  with content-aware review (not generic advice)
- [ ] User uploads an offer letter → types "summarize it" → Rico summarizes using the document type
- [ ] No regression in job-search or onboarding flows (all existing tests pass)

### TASK-20260621-029 — System quality audit: bug fixes and technical debt documentation

Status: review
Owner: Claude
Branch: `claude/system-quality-audit-ikkamf`
Issue/PR: #717 (draft, CI green — pytest ✅ playwright ✅ Vercel ✅)

#### Objective

Continuous codebase audit across auth, DB, repositories, services, migrations, and routers —
fix small isolated bugs immediately, document larger issues for separate PRs.

#### Bugs fixed (all in commit `3c11717`)

1. **`src/repositories/users_repo.py`** — `list_active_users()` omitted `email_verified` from
   SELECT; all User objects silently defaulted to `email_verified=True`. Fixed by adding
   `COALESCE(email_verified, TRUE)` as column 8 and accessing as `row[7]`.

2. **`src/repositories/audit_repo.py`** — `List` used in type annotations for
   `log_profile_hydration` and `_db_write_profile_hydration` but not imported;
   `typing.get_type_hints()` would raise `NameError`. Fixed by adding `List` to
   `from typing import …`.

3. **`src/api/auth.py`** — Duplicate `response.delete_cookie()` call in `register()`
   (second call at lines 580-583 was dead code, identical to lines 482-485). Removed.

4. **`tests/test_users_scheduler.py`** — Mock fixture rows were 7-element tuples; crashed with
   `IndexError: tuple index out of range` after the `users_repo` fix added an 8th column.
   Updated both rows to 8-element tuples.

#### Issues documented (separate PRs required — do NOT touch without explicit scope)

| # | Issue | File | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Runtime DDL bypasses migration system | `audit_repo.py` | Move 3 table creates to numbered migrations |
| D2 | `_DEDUP_CACHE` unbounded memory growth | `audit_repo.py` | Add periodic sweep or size cap in `_mem_seed` |
| D3 | Safety regex over-breadth (`password`, `bypass`) | `rico_safety.py` | Narrow with word-boundary anchors + regression tests |
| D4 | No password complexity enforcement | `src/api/auth.py` | Add length + complexity check at register and reset |
| D5 | No JWT revocation after password reset | `src/api/auth.py` | Token blacklist or rotating JWT family ID |
| D6 | `mark_webhook_event_processed` Optional[str] for UUID FK | `src/rico_db.py` | Validate UUID or change signature to Optional[UUID] |

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] `list_active_users()` returns correct `email_verified` value from DB
- [x] `audit_repo.py` imports `List` — no `NameError` from `get_type_hints()`
- [x] No duplicate cookie deletion in `register()`
- [x] Test fixture updated to 8-element tuples
- [x] All CI checks green (pytest, playwright, Vercel, Neon)

#### Required verification

- [x] pytest ✅ (all 6 CI checks passed on PR #717)
- [x] playwright ✅
- [x] Vercel ✅ (DEPLOYED)
- [x] No regressions vs main baseline

#### Handoff notes

- Changed files: `src/repositories/users_repo.py`, `src/repositories/audit_repo.py`,
  `src/api/auth.py`, `tests/test_users_scheduler.py`, `AI_WORKSPACE/CURRENT_STATE.md`,
  `AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md`, `AI_WORKSPACE/START_HERE.md`
- Rollback plan: revert PR #717 — no DB schema changes, no migrations, no env changes.
- Full detail: `AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-06-21-system-quality-audit.md`

### TASK-20260619-028 — UI/UX live-audit backlog (2026-06-19)

Status: proposed (tracking task — spin each item into its own TASK-NNN when picked up)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: —
Issue/PR: docs-only (this ledger entry)

#### Objective

Track the prioritized recommendations from the 2026-06-19 live production UI/UX audit so they
are not lost in chat history. Full detail (problem + fix + mockups) lives in
`docs/audits/ui-ux-live-audit-2026-06-19.md` (shipped via #658); this entry is the actionable
backlog distilled from it.

#### Source

Direct live audit of `ricohunt.com` covering `/command`, `/flow`, `/profile`, `/upload`,
`/settings`, `/subscription`, and the global sidebar. 20 recommendations, prioritized by
impact vs. effort. `ref` below = the section id in the audit doc.

#### Backlog (grouped by audit impact)

Critical:

- [x] 1-A — Replace A/B/C/D typed options with clickable inline action buttons. DONE via PR #678.
- [x] 1-B — Real fit-score badge on job cards (e.g. "82% match") + skills/gaps/location breakdown. DONE via PR #679.

High:

- [x] 1-D — Sidebar widgets load on every mount. DONE via TASK-20260619-027 / PR #658.
- [ ] 2-D — "Mark as Applied" inline CTA button on Link-opened cards.
- [ ] 3-B — Surface profile conflict warnings as a top-of-page banner.
- [ ] 5-A — Input validation: City (UAE list), Target roles (max 3–4), excluded-vs-target keyword warn.
- [ ] 1-C — Search timeout/countdown indicator with reliable fallback buttons (30s).
- [ ] 3-A — Profile completeness score: single source of truth (sidebar 71% vs profile 54%).

Medium:

- [x] 6-A — Navy/indigo design system. DONE via PR #641 (v4 tokens, `6fac4c0`); live + smoke-PASS 2026-06-20.
- [ ] 2-A — Demote "Link Opened" from a primary pipeline stage to card metadata.
- [ ] 4-A — CV role-mismatch warning banner on My Files.
- [ ] 6-B — First-use onboarding checklist (dismissable).
- [ ] 1-E — Cold-start amber banner ("Rico is starting up ~45s").

Low:

- [ ] 6-D — Move WhatsApp support to a floating help icon; free the sidebar for navigation.

Additional (in the audit body, outside the top-14 priority table):

- [ ] 2-B — Drag-and-drop between pipeline columns / larger stage pill.
- [ ] 2-C — Collapse zero-value pipeline stat boxes; lead with Applied/Interview/Offer.
- [ ] 3-C — "Active CV" indicator chip on the Profile page.
- [ ] 4-B — CV parse-confidence indicator + "Review parsed data".
- [ ] 5-B — Fit-score slider guidance text (explain what 80% hides).
- [ ] 6-C — Visual hierarchy: make "Ask Rico" the dominant sidebar action.

#### Constraints

- Docs/ledger only in this PR — no code changes.
- Each item becomes its own scoped TASK-NNN + branch when implemented. Do not start without
  explicit scope/branch assignment (per the Operating target in `CURRENT_STATE.md`).

#### Notes

- Per the audit, 1-A is the biggest UX win for the least effort — likely first to spin out.
- Sourced solely from the in-repo 2026-06-19 live audit doc. If a separate/larger UI/UX
  review exists, append its items here rather than starting a parallel list.

### TASK-20260619-027 — Sidebar status widgets: retry after failed cold-start load

Status: done (verified — production smoke PASS 2026-06-20)
Owner: Claude
Branch: `fix/sidebar-status-retry-653` (merged → `712be79` via PR #658)
Issue/PR: #658 (replaced #653, which was closed/superseded)

#### Objective

Stop the desktop sidebar READINESS/PIPELINE widgets from showing permanent blank grey boxes
when navigating back to a page after a cold-start (backend-idle) load.

#### Root cause

`useSidebarStatus` cached failed/empty cold-start loads for 60s. When the backend was cold,
all sources resolved to `null`, that empty result was cached, and subsequent remounts served
the stuck nulls — so the widgets stayed blank on navigate-back.

#### Fix (PR #658, merged `712be79`, 2026-06-19)

- `loadStatus()` uses `Promise.allSettled` and throws when both core reads (profile + stats)
  reject, so a failed cold-start is never cached and the next mount retries.
- Cached successes are served instantly and revalidated (stale-while-revalidate) to avoid flicker.
- Sidebar shows a retry affordance when status can't load (`navStatusRetry`, en + ar); the chip
  calls a TTL-bypassing `refresh()`.
- Changed files: `apps/web/hooks/useSidebarStatus.ts`,
  `apps/web/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`, `apps/web/lib/translations.ts`,
  `docs/audits/ui-ux-live-audit-2026-06-19.md` (audit doc).

#### Verification

- `npm run build` green; CI (pytest + playwright) green on #658.
- Production smoke PASS (2026-06-20): widgets render on mount, repopulate instantly on
  navigate-back (SWR), skeleton→data on hard refresh. Retry chip not exercised (Render warm —
  `status.error` only flips when both core reads reject on a cold mount); rendering path is
  covered by build + the both-locale `navStatusRetry` key. Smoke table recorded on PR #658
  (issuecomment-4756899519).

#### Notes

- Addresses audit item 1-D (see TASK-20260619-028).
- This is NOT TASK-024 — earlier chat shorthand mislabeled it. TASK-024 is BUG-04. The sidebar
  fix had no ledger ID until this entry, which closes that gap.

### TASK-20260619-026 — BUG-05: Public-chat onboarding infinite loop

Status: review
Owner: Claude
Branch: `claude/ai-workspace-review-vtdjrb`
Issue/PR: (draft PR created 2026-06-19)

#### Objective

Fix the `/command` public chat returning identical "Welcome to Rico AI…" on every message
after the first, and the double API call from the streaming fallback guard.

#### Root cause

Three compounding issues:

1. `IntentRouter` sends most messages (not starting with `?` / question word / "show me") to
   the legacy classifier.
2. Legacy classifier always returns the onboarding welcome when `profile is None`, and never
   saves state for public sessions (`_persist=False`), creating an infinite loop.
3. Frontend `if (!streamStarted)` fallback fired even when the legacy path already applied a
   response via the SSE `"done"` event — causing a duplicate API call.

#### Fix summary

- **Fix A** (`src/services/chat_service.py`): `_force_ai` gate redirects public no-profile
  legacy decisions to `_conversational_ai_reply`.
- **Fix B** (`src/api/routers/rico_chat.py`): streaming endpoint only takes legacy path when
  `profile is not None`.
- **Fix C** (`apps/web/app/command/page.tsx`): fallback guard changed to
  `!streamStarted && !responseApplied`.
- 7 unit tests in `tests/test_public_chat_no_profile_loop.py` (all PASS).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Public user messages (interview prep, profile data, injection) route to AI, not welcome
- [x] Public user WITH existing profile still routes to legacy (unchanged)
- [x] Authenticated users unaffected (legacy for no-profile, AI for AI-decision)
- [x] No duplicate API call from streaming fallback
- [x] 7 unit tests passing

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: 7/7 PASS (`tests/test_public_chat_no_profile_loop.py`)
- [ ] Frontend build: node_modules not installed in this environment; change is a 1-line guard
- [ ] Render deploy: pending PR merge
- [ ] Production smoke: pending PR merge

#### Handoff notes

- Changed files: `src/services/chat_service.py`, `src/api/routers/rico_chat.py`,
  `apps/web/app/command/page.tsx`, `tests/test_public_chat_no_profile_loop.py`
- Risks: `_force_ai` gate is additive; authenticated users and public users with profiles
  are unaffected. Rollback: revert `_force_ai` conditional in `send_message`.
- Open: #653 sidebar retry still draft; unrelated to BUG-05.

### TASK-20260716-001 — Gmail M0 read-only connector

Status: done — merged; inactive in production
Merge/runtime state (explanatory, not a status value): #1055 merged into `main`
        2026-07-17; the feature is INACTIVE — `RICO_ENABLE_GMAIL_SYNC=false` and
        migration 043 not auto-applied (see reconciliation below).
Owner: Windsurf (REVIEWER → WRITER for blocker fixes);
       post-merge reconciliation by Claude (2026-07-17)
Branch: `feat/gmail-readonly-connector-m0` (merged, head `a10a6493`)
Issue/PR: #1055 — MERGED 2026-07-17T08:32:45Z by Binz2008-star,
          merge commit `bcd71c2`, 19 files (+3497/-3), 15 commits

#### Post-merge reconciliation (audited on `main` `900972c`, merge commit `bcd71c2`)

The three P1 review blockers were tracked against the pre-merge draft head
(`dd595a3b`); the branch then advanced to `a10a6493` (15 commits) before merge.
Audited the exact MERGED code + tests on `main` `900972c` (not the PR body or the
old ledger). Result: blockers 1 and 3 are RESOLVED in the merged head; blocker 2
is PARTIALLY RESOLVED — the backend privacy gate is fully implemented, but fleet
activation remains blocked by a missing user-facing consent flow (recorded as a
separate pre-fleet task, TASK-20260717-009). Migration 043 is not auto-applied at
startup (it is absent from the startup auto-apply list —
`migrations/043_gmail_connections.sql:7-11`), so its production application remains
blocked pending a fresh owner-approved Neon verification; `RICO_ENABLE_GMAIL_SYNC`
remains `false` by default (`test_status_shape_flag_off`,
`tests/test_gmail_connector_m0.py:149-163`), so nothing in this feature is live.
Validation:
`pytest tests/test_gmail_connector_m0.py` → 36 passed. This reconciliation is
docs-only — no code, migration, secret, or flag was touched.

#### Objective

First-party OAuth Gmail read-only connector (M0): connect, bounded inbox sync,
recruiter-thread detection wired into existing review machinery. Everything OFF
by default behind `RICO_ENABLE_GMAIL_SYNC=false`.

  - 26 connector tests pass, 540 vitest pass, frontend build green
  - GitHub required CI all green on head `dd595a3b`
- What is incomplete (post-merge): the user-facing recurring-sync consent control
  (blocker 2 UI half — TASK-20260717-009); independent security/privacy review;
  isolated migration-043 verification on a throwaway Neon branch; limited
  real-account OAuth test with a tester allowlist. These are activation gates, not
  merge blockers — the code is on `main`, inactive.
- Blocker verdicts (audited on `main` `900972c` / merge commit `bcd71c2` — code +
  tests, not comments; the 3 P1 blockers were originally logged on `dd595a3b`):
  1. **Privacy/revocation — RESOLVED.** `/status` resolves the real connection
     unconditionally and reports `connected` independent of the flag
     (`src/api/routers/integrations_gmail.py:88`, `:101-115`; repo
     `src/repositories/gmail_repo.py:64`), and `/disconnect` is deliberately
     ungated (`integrations_gmail.py:182-193`). Frontend keeps a live connection
     visible and Disconnect always enabled while the flag is off
     (`apps/web/components/settings/GmailConnectionCard.tsx:118-133` and
     `:231-241` — Disconnect `disabled={busy}` only, never the flag). Regression:
     `test_status_reports_connection_even_when_flag_off`
     (`tests/test_gmail_connector_m0.py:166-191`) — asserts `connected:true` +
     `sync_enabled:false` + Disconnect 200 with the flag off.
  2. **Consent/scope — PARTIALLY RESOLVED.** *Backend privacy gate implemented;
     fleet activation remains blocked by missing user-facing consent flow.*
     Backend substrate complete: consent column `recurring_sync_consent_at`
     (`migrations/043_gmail_connections.sql:39`, idempotent add `:51-52`,
     consent-scoped sweep index `:66-69`); JWT-scoped grant/revoke
     `POST /consent` (`integrations_gmail.py:199-228`) →
     `set_recurring_sync_consent` (`gmail_repo.py:270-306`); the fleet query
     selects only consented rows — `list_active_connections`
     `WHERE status = 'active' AND recurring_sync_consent_at IS NOT NULL`
     (`gmail_repo.py:88-117`). Tests: `test_fleet_sweep_query_requires_consent`
     (`tests/test_gmail_connector_m0.py:573`), `test_consent_grant_round_trip` /
     `test_consent_revoke_round_trip` (`:489`, `:506`),
     `test_manual_sync_does_not_require_recurring_consent` (`:630`).
     **GAP (still open):** the Settings UI exposes NO control to grant or revoke
     this recurring-sync consent — `GmailConnectionCard.tsx` renders only
     Connect / Sync / Disconnect and never imports the existing
     `setGmailRecurringSyncConsent` helper (`apps/web/lib/api.ts:968`). Tracked as
     separate pre-fleet task **TASK-20260717-009**. NOT implemented here (docs-only).
  3. **Trust/idempotency — RESOLVED.** Approval is a single atomic conditional
     claim — `claim_review_item_for_approval` runs one
     `UPDATE ... SET review_status='approved' WHERE user_id=%s AND id=%s AND
     review_status='pending' RETURNING ...` so exactly one racer wins
     (`gmail_repo.py:583-622`); the router claims before applying and reverts the
     claim on apply failure (`integrations_gmail.py:336`, `:349-352`), and the
     status apply is itself idempotent. Regression:
     `test_double_approve_applies_status_exactly_once` — second racer 409s,
     `update_status.call_count == 1`, revert not called
     (`tests/test_gmail_connector_m0.py:393-426`).
- Validation already run (pre-merge):
  - `pytest tests/test_gmail_connector_m0.py` → 26/26 passed
  - `pytest tests/test_gmail_pagination_bounds.py` → 8/8 passed (bounded-pagination fix)
  - `pytest tests/unit/test_migration_drift_checks.py` → 5/5 passed
  - `npm run build` → 41/41 pages · `npm test -- --run` → 540/540 · CI green
- Validation re-run (post-merge reconciliation, `main` `900972c`):
  - `pytest tests/test_gmail_connector_m0.py` → 36/36 passed
- **Merge gates — SATISFIED (merged 2026-07-17).** For the record: blockers 1 and
  3 were fixed with tests; blocker 2's backend gate was fixed with tests (its UI
  half is a pre-fleet activation gate, TASK-20260717-009). Independent
  security/privacy review, isolated migration-043 verification, and a real-account
  OAuth test were NOT bundled into the merge and remain owner-gated activation
  prerequisites below.
- **Activation gates (SEPARATE — the feature is INACTIVE until every one is met;
  owner-gated; nothing here is unblocked by the merge):**
  - Google restricted-scope verification / CASA for `gmail.readonly` on the public domain.
  - Provision `GMAIL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` + Google OAuth creds in Render.
  - Apply migration 043 to Neon production — not auto-applied at startup;
    production application remains blocked pending a fresh owner-approved Neon
    verification (no retained in-session evidence of a production table check).
  - **User-facing recurring-sync consent flow before enabling `/sync-all`** — the
    backend gate exists, but no Settings control does; blocks any fleet sweep.
    Tracked as TASK-20260717-009.
  - Independent (non-author) security/privacy review + isolated migration-043
    verification on a throwaway Neon branch + limited real-account OAuth test.
  - Flip `RICO_ENABLE_GMAIL_SYNC=true` last, per-cohort.
- Next exact action: none for M0 code (merged). Before any fleet activation, land
  TASK-20260717-009 and clear the remaining activation gates above, owner-gated.
- Stop condition: do not deploy/activate, apply migration 043, provision secrets,
  add a fleet workflow, or enable `RICO_ENABLE_GMAIL_SYNC` without explicit owner
  approval.
- Rollback plan: revert merge commit `bcd71c2` on `main`; no production impact
  either way (flag is OFF; migration 043 not auto-applied).

### TASK-20260717-009 — Gmail recurring-sync consent: user-facing Settings control

Status: scoped (pre-fleet activation gate for #1055 / Gmail M0)
Owner: unassigned
Branch: TBD
Issue/PR: TBD

#### Objective

Add a user-facing control in the Gmail Settings card to grant and revoke the
separate recurring/fleet-sync consent that the backend already gates on. Without
it, no user can opt in, so the fleet sweep (`/sync-all`) can never legitimately
process anyone — this blocks fleet activation even after the flag is flipped.

#### Context

- Discovered by the post-merge reconciliation of #1055 (audited on `main`
  `900972c`). Backend privacy gate is fully implemented; only the UI is missing.
- Precise classification: *backend privacy gate implemented; fleet activation
  remains blocked by missing user-facing consent flow.*
- Backend already in place (do NOT rebuild):
  - Column: `recurring_sync_consent_at` — `migrations/043_gmail_connections.sql:39`
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/integrations/gmail/consent` (JWT-scoped) —
    `src/api/routers/integrations_gmail.py:199-228`
  - Repo setter: `set_recurring_sync_consent` — `src/repositories/gmail_repo.py:270-306`
  - Fleet filter: `list_active_connections` (consented rows only) —
    `src/repositories/gmail_repo.py:88-117`
  - Frontend API helper ALREADY EXISTS but is unused by the card:
    `setGmailRecurringSyncConsent` — `apps/web/lib/api.ts:968`
  - `GmailStatusResponse.recurring_sync_consent` is already returned by `/status`.
- Gap to close: `apps/web/components/settings/GmailConnectionCard.tsx` renders only
  Connect / Sync / Disconnect. Add a clear grant/revoke control (e.g. a toggle)
  that reads `status.recurring_sync_consent`, calls `setGmailRecurringSyncConsent`,
  and refreshes status. EN + AR copy; plain language that this authorizes recurring
  background sync (distinct from the read grant and from manual sync).

#### Constraints

- Scope is UI + wiring only — no backend, migration, secret, or flag changes.
- Only meaningful once a connection exists (mirror the backend 409-when-not-connected).
- Revoke must always be available (privacy-reducing action), consistent with Disconnect.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Connected users can clearly grant recurring/background Gmail-sync consent.
- Connected users can revoke that consent at any time, including while sync is disabled.
- The control reads the real `recurring_sync_consent` status and refreshes after mutation.
- Manual Sync remains separate and does not grant recurring consent.
- No control is shown as active for an unconnected account.
- EN and AR copy clearly distinguish OAuth read access, manual sync, and recurring
  background sync.
- No migration, backend, environment flag, fleet workflow, or production activation change.

#### Required verification

- `GmailConnectionCard` unit tests for: grant, revoke, disabled-sync revoke, API
  failure, and unconnected state.
- Existing Gmail frontend tests (regression).
- Complete frontend vitest suite.
- Production frontend build (`npm run build` in `apps/web`).
- EN/AR and mobile visual check.

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260717-009
- GitHub issue/PR: TBD
- Branch: TBD
- Base branch: main
- Last safe commit SHA: TBD (branch not yet cut)
- Uncommitted changes present: no
- Status: scoped
- Files expected to change:
  - `apps/web/components/settings/GmailConnectionCard.tsx` — add grant/revoke control
  - `apps/web/lib/translations*` (EN + AR strings for the three sync concepts)
  - `apps/web/components/settings/__tests__/` (or the existing Gmail card test path)
    — new vitest cases for grant/revoke/disabled-sync-revoke/API-failure/unconnected
  - (wiring only) reuse `setGmailRecurringSyncConsent` (`apps/web/lib/api.ts:968`)
    and `GmailStatusResponse.recurring_sync_consent` — no new API surface
- Files/areas explicitly excluded:
  - `migrations/*` (043 already carries the column) — no migration change
  - `src/**` backend (endpoint + repo + fleet filter already exist) — no backend change
  - env flags (`RICO_ENABLE_GMAIL_SYNC`), Render/Neon/Vercel config — untouched
  - `.github/workflows/*` — no fleet/sweep workflow added
- Next exact action: cut a branch, implement the toggle in `GmailConnectionCard.tsx`
  wired to `setGmailRecurringSyncConsent`, add EN/AR strings, add the five vitest
  cases above, run the frontend suite + build, EN/AR + mobile visual check.
- Stop condition: this task does NOT enable sync, apply migration 043, provision
  secrets, or add a fleet workflow — those remain separate owner-gated activation
  gates; do not activate anything without explicit owner approval.
- Rollback plan: revert the single frontend PR; no production impact (the control
  only records a consent flag the fleet sweep already honors, and the sweep itself
  stays gated OFF).

### TASK-20260716-002 — Career Memory Engine M1 (shadow, flag OFF)

Status: blocked (paused — hold as draft pending shadow evidence)
Owner: Claude (reconciled with main; independent review pending)
Branch: `feat/memory-engine-m1`
Issue/PR: #1025 (draft)

#### Objective

Additive career-memory substrate (M1): migration 042 (`career_memory_events` /
`career_memory_facts`), a shadow `MemoryWriter` inside `agent_runtime.handle_action`
(after the legacy write, own try/except — cannot change the action result), no
`MemoryReader`, feature flag `RICO_MEMORY_ENGINE_ENABLED=false` + kill switch +
circuit breaker. No user-visible behavior change.

- Validation already run: `test_memory_engine_m1` 38/38; legacy memory + runtime
  suites 74/74; postgres integration correctly gated (skipped without DATABASE_URL);
  migration 042 confirmed next-free (after 041); drift signatures match objects
- Invariants verified: flag OFF default + kill switch + circuit breaker; shadow-only
  (write never raises); no `MemoryReader` anywhere; `public:*` sessions never merge
  into accounts. Caveat: `_EXCLUDED_KEY_RE` matches payload KEYS not values (safe
  today because the shadow payload is minimized to action/title/company/job_key/surface)
- Next exact action: keep DRAFT + flag OFF; independent review; measure shadow
  writes (failures/duplication/drift) before any MemoryReader or activation
- Stop condition: do not merge, activate the flag, or add a MemoryReader without
  explicit owner approval + shadow-evidence review
- Rollback plan: revert PR; migration 042 is additive (code tolerates the schema);
  flag OFF means no runtime path exercises it

### TASK-20260716-003 — Opening-film chooser: rotate on every guest visit, non-repeating 3-film cycle

Status: review → merge authorized. Containment exception RECORDED: the owner
(Binz2008-star) explicitly authorized merging #1085 via direct in-session
instruction ("Ok do it", 2026-07-16, after the review notes were addressed
and CI was green), taking it ahead of secret rotation / #1066 / #1067 / #1068
in merge order. Production deploy of main via Vercel follows automatically.
Owner: Claude (owner directive delivered in-session, 2026-07-16)
Branch: `claude/rico-film-rotation-fix-g7tua4`
Issue/PR: #1085 (draft)

#### Objective

Guests opening ricohunt.com get the launch film on EVERY visit (retire the
once-per-browser-session gate), rotating exactly option-2 / option-3 /
option-3b in a randomized non-repeating cycle (all three before any repeat),
with reload/revisit re-entering the chooser instead of staying locked to the
previously selected option URL. Preserve the authenticated `/command`
redirect, `/signup` CTAs, SEO prerender, and all film content.

- Branch: `claude/rico-film-rotation-fix-g7tua4`
- Base branch: main (`5cb1fd13`)
- Status: review — Draft/HELD; owner to record containment exception and merge
  order relative to secret rotation, #1066/#1067, #1068 before any merge; no
  production deploy (Vercel PREVIEW auto-deploys on push, as with every PR)

### TASK-20260716-004 — After the films comes the landing page (+ film-boot robustness fix)

Status: merge authorized — owner (Binz2008-star) explicitly said "merge"
in-session (2026-07-16) after CI went green and the Vercel preview was up;
containment exception recorded, same basis as TASK-20260716-003 / #1085.
Owner: Claude
Branch: `claude/rico-film-rotation-fix-g7tua4` (restarted from main after #1085 merged)
Issue/PR: follow-up to #1085

#### Objective

1. A rotation film's single pass ends by handing the visitor to the landing
   page (`/?after-film=1` → landing renders once, marker stripped, next "/"
   entry rotates again) instead of looping forever. Skip/Join keep /signup.
2. Robustness fix discovered while verifying: replace the chooser's
   fetch + document.write film render (merged in #1085) with a real
   navigation tagged `#rico-rotation` + in-film `history.replaceState` mask.
   A parser-inserted end-of-body script waits on pending stylesheets, so a
   stalled fonts CDN froze the written film entirely; native navigation has
   no such dependency and keeps the same reload-re-enters-rotation behavior.

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260716-004
- Files touched: `apps/web/public/explainer/index.html`,
  `apps/web/public/explainer/option-2.html` / `option-3.html` / `option-3b.html`
  (goLanding at end of pass + #rico-rotation URL mask; visuals/copy/CTAs untouched),
  `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `apps/web/lib/openingFilm.ts` (claimAfterFilmLanding),
  `apps/web/__tests__/landing-opening-film.test.tsx`,
  `apps/web/__tests__/explainer-film-rotation.test.ts`,
  `apps/web/public/explainer/README.md`
- Validation already run: vitest 600/600; next build green; real-Chromium E2E:
  "/" → film plays (scene active = script live, URL masked to chooser) →
  fast-forward → landing renders once with marker stripped → reload → next film
- Next exact action: owner merge word; production deploy via Vercel on merge

### TASK-20260717-001 — Stabilize flaky chat-confirm-profile vitest file (CI tax)

Status: review (re-executed 2026-07-19 under owner authorization "next after

# 1195"; test-only change)

Owner: Claude (Fable session)
Branch: `claude/growth-lifecycle-automation-qiyzw6` (restarted from main after

# 1195 merged; the 2026-07-17 branch `claude/rico-film-rotation-fix-g7tua4` was

NEVER pushed to origin — verified absent 2026-07-19 — and its validated fix was
lost with its session)
Issue/PR: follow-up; flaked 3x on 2026-07-16 (#1085 and #1116 CI, plus one
local run) and 2x on 2026-07-19 (#1195 CI, both heads) — always
`chat-confirm-profile.test.tsx > handleConfirmProfile`

#### Objective

Remove the two flake modes without weakening the guard:

1. 5s default test timeout too tight for the full CommandPage render + CV
   upload flow on loaded CI runners → per-test 15s timeout on the three
   heavy tests.
2. Raw `fetchMock.mock.calls.length` equality races with `useAuth`'s
   per-mount `/api/v1/me` re-check (the Edit click mounts the editor panel)
   → count only non-`/api/v1/me` calls, and additionally assert that
   neither `/chat/public` nor `confirm-cv-profile` is ever called by Edit.

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260717-001
- Files touched: `apps/web/__tests__/chat-confirm-profile.test.tsx` only
- Validation: file passed 10/10 consecutive local runs post-fix
- Next exact action: PR, CI green, merge under the in-session autonomy grant

#### Re-execution addendum (2026-07-19)

The two 2026-07-17 fix modes (15s test timeouts; non-`/me` call counting) had
already landed in the file, yet the flake recurred 2x on #1195's CI — proving
them insufficient. Stress reproduction (parallel double-vitest load, failure
caught at ~1/40 runs with full output) isolated two REAL causes, each cured
test-side only:

1. **Lost upload** — a single dispatched upload can be silently dropped
   (`handleCVUpload` returns early while `chatAudience === "checking"`; an
   upload onto a just-detached input during a composer re-render goes
   nowhere). Cure: `uploadCVUntilAccepted()` retries fresh-query → upload
   until the accepted upload's `/api/v1/rico/upload-cv` request is observed
   on the fetch mock.
2. **CPU starvation** — with the upload provably accepted, the preview card
   took >5s to render under load (caught at 5.4s), blowing the 5s findBy.
   Cure: 15s affordance timeouts under a 30s per-test budget.

Validation (this head): single run 3/3; **30/30 parallel-stress runs**
(the same load that reproduced the failure pre-fix); full vitest suite
**789/789 across 76 files**. No product code touched.

### TASK-20260717-002 — Job Result Integrity Gate (incident #1121)

Status: review
Owner: model
Branch: fix/job-result-integrity-gate
Issue/PR: incident #1121 → Draft PR #1123 (this branch) → TASK-20260717-002

Traceability: Issue #1121 (the real Job Result Integrity incident) → Draft PR

# 1123 → TASK-20260717-002. The PR "Addresses #1121" (not "Closes") and must not

auto-close #1121 while Draft. #1118 is a DIFFERENT issue (the CV-parse quality
gate for #1119) and is not tracked here.

#### Hierarchy

- Vision → Career Operating System
- Epic → Rico Command Runtime Restoration
- Milestone → Trusted Job Search
- Phase → Job Result Integrity Gate
- Issue → #1121 (production Job Result Integrity failure)
- PR → Draft PR #1123, one objective: reject non-trustworthy listings before scoring/card/shortlist
- Tests → provider-to-card integrity contract (`tests/test_job_result_integrity.py`)

#### Incident

Production surfaced a Totaljobs listing — title "Project Manager", body "Mental
Health Practitioner / Recovery Service", location Manchester (UK), apply state
Unavailable — in a UAE workflow. Withdraws the prior "job-search vertical is
genuinely strong" assessment. Classes: non-UAE market leak; title/description
role-family conflict; unavailable/dead apply link; no trust decision before
scoring/shortlist admission.

#### Objective

Rico owns the final trust decision: a job may be CV-scored, carded, or shortlisted
only after Market + Role + Listing + Freshness + Evidence integrity pass.

#### Root cause

`src/job_providers.py` forwards `country="ae"` only to JSearch; Adzuna is hard-
scoped to its GB index (`ADZUNA_COUNTRY` default `gb`) and the cascade short-
circuits on the first provider with items, with NO post-cascade market/role/
availability filter before scoring. First layer that should have rejected the
record: market/country normalization.

#### Fix

- `src/job_integrity.py` (new): `RejectionReason` + `validate_listing` +
  `filter_listings` (market/role/title-body-conflict/availability/apply-url/
  source-page/freshness/evidence). Role step: the REQUESTED role's own
  occupational domain participates in the title/body comparison (protected-domain
  review fix) — a valid Nurse/Mental-Health request is not falsely conflicted.
  Protected-domain detection is bilingual (EN + Arabic vocabulary) so Arabic
  listings are validated with Arabic signals, never skipped; sparse Arabic
  evidence → `INSUFFICIENT_LISTING_EVIDENCE`. `filter_listings` tags each
  accepted record `apply_verified` (True only with a usable http(s) URL).
- `src/rico_chat_api.py`: run the gate in `_target_role_search_response` right
  after fetch, before scoring/formatting/shortlist; surface a safe aggregate
  `integrity_filtered` count only. `_format_match` surfaces `apply_verified` on
  the card (tied to the resolved usable link) so a missing/invalid-link card
  renders the fallback CTA and never an Apply action.
- `src/job_providers.py`: drop Adzuna from the cascade when its configured index
  ≠ the requested country (stops the GB short-circuit).

#### Constraints

- Do not touch PR #1119 files (`src/api/routers/rico_chat.py`, `src/cv_parser.py`,
  `src/cv_parse_quality.py`, and their tests).
- No new providers; no broadened search; no UI redesign; no migrations.
- Context-durability (reload → recent_search_role loss) is a SEPARATE defect — not
  in this PR.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] UAE search rejects UK/non-UAE listings even at high provider rank.
- [x] title/body role-family conflict (Project Manager + Mental Health) rejected.
- [x] protected-domain request (Nurse / Mental Health Practitioner) NOT falsely
      conflicted; requested role's own domain participates in the comparison.
- [x] unavailable listing / malformed apply URL never a recommendation; missing
      URL kept as unverified (`apply_verified=false`), never an Apply action.
- [x] valid UAE listing remains scoreable; rejected never scored/carded/shortlisted
      (proven through the real `_target_role_search_response` path).
- [x] Arabic listings validated with Arabic vocabulary (not skipped); conflicts
      caught; insufficient Arabic evidence → INSUFFICIENT_LISTING_EVIDENCE.
- [ ] PRE-MERGE BRANCH QUALITY SMOKE (branch/local, NOT production — production
      runs main): five role searches, zero UK/mismatch/unavailable in top 10.

#### Separate follow-up (do NOT implement here)

- Search-context durability: `recent_search_role` non-durable under
  `RICO_MEMORY_BACKEND=postgres`; multi-role option click triggers page reload;
  refinement falls back to profile after reload. Tracked separately.

### TASK-20260718-023 — Data-integrity foundation: posting-history archive + learning-signal hygiene

Status: done
Owner: Claude (Fable session, owner-directed "choose highest long-term impact and execute")
Branch: claude/release-captain-queue-76nrwz
Issue/PR: #1173 (squash `4879c04d`)

#### Objective

Start the two time-sensitive data-integrity foundations of the Product Truth
Sprint: (1) an append-only `job_observations` posting archive (longitudinal
market data cannot be backfilled), and (2) stop + quarantine the daily
pipeline's echo learning-signals (system output recorded as user behavior).

#### Context

- Strategy: owner-approved Product Truth Sprint; owner note "Data Integrity
  before Analytics".
- Evidence: `run_daily._update_learning_repo` recorded pipeline matches as
  user "save" signals (`source="daily_pipeline"`, `auto_saved: True`);
  `jobs` table is a rolling 14-day window (jobs_repo filters
  `date_found >= now() - interval '14 days'`) so posting history was being
  discarded by design.
- Files: `migrations/046_job_observations.sql`,
  `src/repositories/job_observations_repo.py`, hooks in
  `src/jsearch_client.py` (+ `posted_at` passthrough) and
  `src/job_providers.py` (jooble/adzuna), `src/run_daily.py` (writer removed),
  `src/repositories/learning_repo.py` (`_EXCLUDED_SIGNAL_SOURCES` filter at
  DB load, decay aggregation, and write-time EMA).

#### Constraints

- Migration 046 is a FILE ONLY in this PR — applying it to Neon is an owner
  action; the archive code fail-safes to a disabled no-op (pgcode 42P01
  latches off per process) until the table exists.
- `job_observations` carries ZERO user data (market-side only; no PDPL scope).
- Append-only: no update/delete code paths.
- No analytics, no taste-loop UI, no ranking changes in this PR.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Fresh provider fetches (jsearch/jooble/adzuna) record observations;
      cache hits never do.
- [x] Fingerprint v1 is provider-format stable (EN + AR) and versioned.
- [x] Description text never stored (hash + length only); apply URL reduced
      to domain.
- [x] Pipeline echo writer gone; `daily_pipeline` source inert on every read
      path; real user-action signals unaffected (pinned by
      `tests/unit/test_learning_signal_hygiene.py`).
- [x] `tests/unit/test_job_observations_repo.py` +
      `tests/unit/test_learning_signal_hygiene.py` green; adjacent suites
      (jsearch, providers, run_daily-touching) green.

##### Addendum (owner review round, 2026-07-18)

- **Privacy contract amended (owner catch)**: the migration stored raw
  `query_context` while claiming "zero user data" — query text can embed
  profile-derived terms. Resolved: column is now `query_hash CHAR(64)`
  (sha256 one-way); raw query text is never stored nor logged. Hash equality
  fully preserves the longitudinal instrument (same query → same hash).
- **Dual-scope merge accepted (documented per owner's option 2)**: PR #1173
  intentionally carries BOTH (a) the archive and (b) learning-signal hygiene.
  Rationale: one shared objective (data integrity), hygiene is read-path
  filtering + writer removal with no migration dependency, the archive
  fail-safes to a no-op until 046 exists — coupled risk ≈ union of two small
  independent risks; a split would cost a second branch/PR cycle with no
  added safety.
- **Owner-directed rollout gate**: 046 is applied to the Neon PREVIEW branch
  first (`preview/pr-1173-claude/release-captain-queue-76nrwz`, project
  `robenjob`) with table/index/write verification there; production
  application requires a separate explicit owner approval; only then
  Draft → Ready → merge.

##### Addendum 2 (owner privacy review, 2026-07-18 — supersedes the sha256 note above)

- Owner rejected plain sha256: the query space is small/guessable, so an
  unkeyed hash is dictionary-attackable — pseudonymous, NOT "zero user data".
- Approved contract implemented: `query_context_hmac CHAR(64)` =
  HMAC-SHA256(`RICO_ARCHIVE_HMAC_KEY`, normalized query). Key is dedicated
  (never JWT_SECRET), never stored in DB. Absent key ⇒ archive writes skipped
  entirely (fail-closed, one structured warning without query text, search
  unaffected); NO fallback to an unkeyed hash. Documentation claim corrected
  everywhere to: "No direct user identifiers or raw query text; query context
  stored only as a keyed, non-reversible HMAC for longitudinal grouping."
- Drift signature extended with the `query_context_hmac` column so a stale
  pre-review table shape is detected as drift.
- Dual-scope single-PR merge recorded as an EXPLICIT owner-granted exception
  to the one-task-one-PR rule (rationale in Addendum 1).
- Operational note: `RICO_ARCHIVE_HMAC_KEY` must be set on Render for the
  archive to record in production; until then it is safely OFF (fail-closed).

##### Closeout (2026-07-18, post-merge)

- Merged: squash `4879c04d` on `main` (PR #1173; expected-head `fbe1b2e4`
  protection; CI green; 0 review threads).
- Migration 046 applied to Neon `production`
  (`robenjob`/`br-restless-cherry-amq6wj7o`, db `neondb`) with owner
  approval AFTER preview-branch validation; post-apply verification: 17
  columns exact, `query_context_hmac` present, no stale
  `query_context`/`query_hash` columns, both indexes, 0 rows (no synthetic
  data in production). Scheduled drift check reads 046 green from its first
  run (apply-before-merge ordering — no alert window).
- `RICO_ARCHIVE_HMAC_KEY` generated and set on Render by the OWNER
  (value never transited this session); deploy Live confirmed by owner.
  Archive fully armed — first real user search writes the first
  production observations.
- "Deploy to Production" run 29664542075 triggered on `4879c04d`
  (completion tracked via scheduled self check-in).

### TASK-20260719-001 — P1: "Refine search" as a structured action (never chat input)

Status: done
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner CPO decision: fix before analytics/taste-loop)
Branch: claude/refine-search-structured-action
Issue/PR: #1175 (squash `d5f96f1e`)

#### Objective

The "Refine search" card sent its LABEL as a chat message; the intent router
parsed it as a job role ("I didn't catch 'Refine search' as a specific
role"). Separate UI actions from natural language: the card becomes an
`open_drawer` structured action opening a refinement panel; the LLM only ever
sees the final composed search query.

#### Root cause (two layers)

- Contract mismatch: composer sent `payload.prompt`; the frontend reads
  `payload.message` — so the fallback `?? action.label` fired. Same silent
  break affected "Save search" and "Find new jobs".
- The fallback itself: a UI label must never become chat input.

#### Changes

- `src/services/agentic_ui_composer.py`: refine → `open_drawer`
  (`drawer: "refine_search"`, carries `search_query`); all remaining
  `chat_continue` payloads renamed `prompt` → `message`; contract documented
  in the module docstring.
- `apps/web/components/ui/rico/ChatActionCard.tsx`: `chat_continue` enabled
  ONLY with non-empty `payload.message`; label fallback removed (disabled +
  reason instead).
- `apps/web/components/command/RefineSearchPanel.tsx` (new): role prefill +
  UAE city chips; composes a real natural query (EN/AR) sent as a normal
  user message; `page.tsx` `handleOpenDrawer` routes `refine_search` to it.
- Bilingual keys `cmdRefine*` in translations.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Backend contract tests: no `prompt` key anywhere; every chat_continue
      carries non-empty `payload.message`; refine pinned as open_drawer
      (tests/test_agentic_ui_composer.py — 70 green).
- [x] Frontend pins: label NEVER sent as chat input (disabled without
      message); open_drawer passes the full action; panel composes EN/AR
      queries with zero UI wording (chat-action-card + refine-search-panel
      suites; full vitest 724 green; `npm run build` clean).
- [x] Analytics-purity side effect: no more synthetic "Refine search"
      user messages polluting chat history or future analytics.

### TASK-20260719-002 — analytics_events foundation (migration 047)

Status: merged — production migration applied and drift-verified (2026-07-19)
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner directive post-#1175: single-objective PR)
Branch: claude/analytics-events-foundation
Issue/PR: #1176 — merged as c09a929a

#### Objective

Product Truth Sprint track 1 ("eyes"): first-party behavioral event store —
migration + storage foundation ONLY. No emitters wired, no Taste Loop, no
structured-action changes.

#### Scope delivered

- `migrations/047_analytics_events.sql` — append-mostly store; unique
  `dedupe_key` (idempotency); `schema_version` on every row; indexes for
  funnels + retention sweeps. NOT applied anywhere — production application
  requires a separate owner approval gate (preview-first, as 046).
- `src/repositories/analytics_events_repo.py` — `record_event()` (never
  raises; 42P01 latch; ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING) + `purge_expired()`
  (RETENTION_DAYS=180; scheduled invocation is a LATER change).
- Strict `EVENT_ALLOWLIST` (8 events): unknown events rejected, unknown
  properties stripped; values limited to bools, bounded ints, and enum-like
  tokens `^[a-z0-9_.:-]{1,64}$` — free text/emails/query strings are
  significantly reduced (token validator still accepts identifier-shaped
  strings and digit-only values, so caller discipline remains required).
  `search_performed` deliberately has no query-text property.
- Actor = keyed HMAC-SHA256 under dedicated `RICO_ANALYTICS_HMAC_KEY`
  (documented in .env.example; never JWT_SECRET / never the archive key so
  datasets stay unlinkable); absent key ⇒ all writes skipped fail-closed
  with one structured warning; no unkeyed fallback.
- Drift signatures for 047 (table + dedupe index).

#### Rollback

Revert the commit; drop the table if created — nothing references it.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Privacy pins: unknown event rejected without DB touch; PII-shaped
      values cannot pass the validator; raw user id never in a row;
      fail-closed no-key path warns once without identifiers.
- [x] Idempotency pins: client_event_id-stable keys; canonical
      order-independent minute-bucket keys; conflict ⇒ False, no error.
- [x] Resilience pins: DB-down no-op; 42P01 latch; transient errors don't
      latch.
- [x] Retention pin: purge SQL + 180-day constant; bounds validation
      (rejects zero/negative/non-numeric/>3650 without DB connection).
      (tests/unit/test_analytics_events_repo.py — 22 tests.)

##### Housekeeping

TASK-20260719-001 (Refine search structured action): merged as `d5f96f1e`
on `main` (PR #1175, expected-head protection, CI green incl. the new
real-browser smoke) → Status: done.

##### Closeout (2026-07-19, post-merge of #1176)

- Merged: head `25975b63a5e4c16cf24a6dbaf6aa1becb01687b3` → squash
  `c09a929a5ea4baa01b5729387d22b8697e2d4f3b` on `main` (owner-staged
  sequence: QA green on exact head → Ready → Neon Preview runbook →
  expected-head squash).
- Preview validation PASSED on temporary branch `br-tiny-truth-am61levn`
  (details + commands: `AI_WORKSPACE/RUNBOOKS/047-analytics-events-migration.md`).
- **Record correction — the merged PR body froze BEFORE the final round
  and is stale on two points:** it says "NOT applied anywhere" (superseded:
  047 WAS applied to the Neon preview branch as part of the merge gate;
  production remains unapplied and owner-gated) and "Tests (22)"
  (superseded: 31 analytics tests after the guest-identity correction).
  The squash commit message on `main` is the accurate durable record.
- Status is NOT "done" because, in order: production 047 application
  (separate owner approval), `RICO_ANALYTICS_HMAC_KEY` on Render (owner),
  emitters PR (must pass guest SID / honor identity contract +
  allowlist↔DDL lockstep), purge scheduling PR — then baseline collection.
- **PR #1177 ruling (owner):** carries a conflicting
  `047_reasoning_traces.sql`; stays Draft; any future reopen restarts from
  `main` ≥ `c09a929a` with a NEW migration number and a NEW task.

##### Production verification (2026-07-19, read-only)

Migration 047 IS applied to production and drift-verified — this
supersedes the "Status is NOT done" sequencing bullet above on the
apply step only. The preview validation record above is historical and
stands unchanged.

- Verified: **2026-07-19T10:08:50Z** (database clock, read-only session).
- Identity: Neon project `robenjob` (`old-frog-88141983`), branch
  **`production`** (`br-restless-cherry-amq6wj7o`), db `neondb`.
- Schema: `analytics_events` PRESENT; explicit indexes
  `uq_analytics_events_dedupe`, `idx_analytics_events_name_occurred`,
  `idx_analytics_events_occurred` all PRESENT; 10 columns / 4 indexes
  (PK + 3) / 4 CHECK constraints — exactly the runbook Verify targets.
- Drift: full signature sweep replicated read-only on the production
  branch — **55/55 objects PRESENT, 0 missing** (entire `CHECKS` list of
  `scripts/check_migration_drift.py` at `main`, not only 047). The
  scheduled drift-run failures of 2026-07-18 and 2026-07-19 08:35Z
  predated the production application; a future scheduled workflow run
  must independently confirm the current drift state.
- Row count: **0** (count-only query; no payloads were read).

Component status (stated separately, per owner directive):

1. **Schema:** applied to production and drift-verified (above).
2. **Emitters:** wired on `main` (#1179: `job_action` in
   `agent_runtime.handle_action` step 12, `search_performed` in the chat
   search path) and DEPLOYED — `deploy-render.yml` (blocks until
   `/version.commit` matches) succeeded for `11cfbdb6` and `a03b12f1`.
   **No claim is made that analytics collection is operational** — that
   claim requires owner-side verification of the Render HMAC key status.
3. **`RICO_ANALYTICS_HMAC_KEY`:** status **UNVERIFIED from this
   session** — no value was accessed or printed; the verifying session
   has no Render env read access and the production host is
   network-blocked from the sandbox. Row count 0 does **not** prove the
   key's presence or absence (it is equally consistent with an unset
   key, with no qualifying traffic since deploy, or with rejected
   events). Owner-side Render verification is required.
4. **Purge scheduling:** NOT active by design — endpoint + workflow merged
   (#1180), but the workflow `schedule:` ships COMMENTED OUT and
   `RICO_ENABLE_ANALYTICS_PURGE` defaults off (two-gate rollout; see the
   runbook addendum / DEC-20260719-001).

Remaining before "done": owner verifies (and, if absent, sets)
`RICO_ANALYTICS_HMAC_KEY` on Render → baseline collection → purge
schedule enablement (owner-gated).

##### Post-merge audit (2026-07-19) — verdict B: safe with follow-up

Compensating review control: **#1176 was merged without a completed
GitHub review**; this post-merge audit is the compensating review
control for that merge.

- Audit result: **31/31 audit cases passed** — verdict **B: safe with
  follow-up** (no corrective PR, no rollback).
- Open gap: the **malformed-input never-raises** hardening of the event
  recording path remains. With #1179 emitters now wired into live
  runtime paths, this is an **ACTIVE follow-up**, not merely a
  prerequisite for future emitters.
- Policy gap: an **allowlist-growth policy** is required before any
  event #9 is added to `EVENT_ALLOWLIST` (currently 8 events, enforced
  in both the repository layer and the 047 DB CHECK — the lockstep rule
  needs an owner-approved change procedure).

### TASK-20260719-003 — Analytics emitters v1 (minimal wiring: 2 events)

Status: review
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner gate "Analytics HMAC gate: PASS → Emitter PR: UNBLOCKED")
Branch: claude/analytics-emitters-v1
Issue/PR: #1179

#### Objective

Wire the MINIMUM emitter set into the live product so the Product Truth
Sprint's primary metric (return-with-action) becomes measurable. Two events
only — `job_action` + `search_performed` — from two central call sites.
`session_start` deliberately deferred (adds noise, not needed for the metric).

#### Scope delivered

- `src/services/analytics_emitters.py` (new): fail-soft emitters; free
  text is blocked at emitter level: search exposes no caller-supplied
  string payload, and job actions are restricted to the explicit
  _ALLOWED_ACTIONS set; authenticated-only in v1
  (`public:` sessions skipped — guest identity contract exists in the
  foundation; guest emission is a later separately-approved change).
- `src/agent/runtime.py`: step 12 — `job_action` after successful handled
  actions (the mandated action path), double-wrapped fail-soft.
- `src/rico_chat_api.py` `_finalize`: one `search_performed` per finalized
  `job_matches` response — results_count only, NEVER query text.

#### Constraints honored (owner list)

- Minimal events; no scope expansion. No free text. Key used only via the
  foundation's keyed HMAC. Allowlist respected (properties are exact
  subsets). No purge/retention. #1177 untouched.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Fail-soft pins: emitters never raise even when the foundation throws;
      runtime action result and chat response both unaffected when the
      emitter itself raises.
- [x] No-PII pins: emitted properties are exactly {action} / {surface,
      results_count}; signature-level pin that no query-text parameter
      exists; public/missing identities emit nothing.
- [x] Wiring pins: runtime success emits once with (user, action);
      _finalize emits only for job_matches with the match count.
      (tests/unit/test_analytics_emitters.py — 11 tests; foundation 31 +
      runtime 58 suites green alongside.)

##### Addendum — owner review round (2026-07-19)

Owner's independent repo verification found two blockers; both fixed:

- The "signature-level free-text prevention" claim was OVERSTATED
  (`action: Any` / `surface: str` could carry arbitrary text). Corrected to
  real emitter-level enforcement: `emit_search_performed` no longer exposes
  any string parameter (surface fixed internally); `emit_job_action`
  records only values in the explicit `_ALLOWED_ACTIONS` set — anything
  else (free text, unknown tokens, case variants) is dropped, and the
  dropped value is deliberately never logged. New pins: interface-shape
  test covers BOTH emitters; unapproved-action-dropped test.
- `Issue/PR` traceability completed: #1179.

### TASK-20260719-004 — Analytics retention purge scheduling (endpoint + workflow, two-gate rollout)

Status: done (merged as `a03b12f` via #1180; Render deploy verified by
deploy-render run 29680082010 — /version match + /health green. Enablement
gates remain closed per DEC-20260719-001: flag OFF, schedule commented.)
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner audit approval "Approve with minor
refinements", 2026-07-19)
Branch: claude/analytics-purge-retention-audit-43dbwn
Decision: DEC-20260719-001

#### Objective

Wire the scheduled invocation of `purge_expired()` promised by migration
047 ("executed by a scheduled job wired in a LATER change") — the last
engineering increment of the analytics foundation before baseline
collection. One responsibility only: endpoint + workflow + flag + tests +
docs. No migration, no schema change, no guest analytics, no new events,
no batching (deferred until a backlog scenario exists), #1177 untouched.

#### Scope delivered

- `src/api/routers/pipeline.py` — `POST /api/v1/pipeline/analytics-purge`:
  cron-secret guarded; gated by `RICO_ENABLE_ANALYTICS_PURGE` (default OFF,
  fail-closed; disabled = explicit 200 no-op that never touches the repo);
  `?dry_run=true` reports the would-delete count without deleting. The
  retention window is NEVER caller-controlled — no query/body input exists;
  the handler calls the repo with no arguments (internal constant only).
- `src/repositories/analytics_events_repo.py` (minimal) — shared
  `_EXPIRED_PREDICATE_SQL` now builds BOTH the purge DELETE and the new
  read-only `count_expired()` (same bounds validation, never raises), so
  dry-run and delete can never drift.
- `src/schemas/pipeline.py` — `AnalyticsPurgeResponse`.
- `.github/workflows/analytics-purge.yml` — dispatch (dry-run default
  true) + daily schedule shipped COMMENTED OUT (job-alert-emails pattern);
  concurrency group; hard-fail on non-200.
- Docs: `.env.example`, `CLAUDE.md`, RUNBOOKS/047 addendum (flow diagram,
  rollout gates, verification, emergency disable), DEC-20260719-001.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Retention pin: handler signature exposes no retention parameter;
      retention-shaped query params ignored; repo invoked with no
      arguments; window stays the `RETENTION_DAYS=180` constant.
- [x] Fail-closed pins: flag unset/false → 200 `status="disabled"`, zero
      repository access (purge AND count); kill switch outranks dry-run.
- [x] Dry-run pins: counts via the shared predicate, never deletes;
      predicate-identity pinned at the SQL-string level.
- [x] Guard pins: 503 with no `RICO_CRON_SECRET`, 403 on bad secret.
      (tests/unit/test_analytics_purge_endpoint.py — 10 tests;
      tests/unit/test_analytics_events_repo.py 36 tests incl. 4 new
      count_expired pins; emitters 11 green alongside.)

#### Rollout (owner-sequenced, two independent gates)

047 production apply → emitters live → baseline starts → this PR merges
(inert: flag OFF + schedule commented) → owner sets flag on Render →
dry-run dispatch verification → owner uncomments the schedule. Emergency
disable: workflow off (GitHub UI) → flag off (no deploy) → revert PR.
Never clear `RICO_CRON_SECRET` as a disable path (it would 503 every
pipeline sweep).

### TASK-20260719-005 — #1101: private-response cache boundary (backend + edge + client)

Status: review
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner approval "Approved to start #1101 only")
Branch: fix/1101-private-response-cache-boundary
Issue/PR: #1101

#### Objective

No account-scoped API response (identity, profile, CV/files, applications,
billing) can be stored or shared through browser, proxy, Vercel BFF/CDN, or
application-managed caches. One logical change: a three-layer no-store
boundary. Explicitly out of scope: #1104, #1130, migration 045, billing/
Gmail/analytics/design changes.

#### Scope delivered

- `src/api/cache_privacy.py` (new): pure-ASGI `PrivateCacheHeadersMiddleware`
  — every response without a route-set Cache-Control gets
  `private, no-store, max-age=0` + `Pragma: no-cache` + `Expires: 0`;
  `Cookie`/`Authorization`/`Origin` merged into `Vary` (never clobbers,
  `Vary: *` respected). Registered outermost in `src/api/app.py`. SSE keeps
  its route-set `no-cache, no-transform` (preserved, proven by test).
- `apps/web/next.config.js`: `/proxy/:path*` headers block —
  `Cache-Control: private, no-store, max-age=0`, `CDN-Cache-Control` +
  `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control: no-store`, `Pragma`, `Vary` — public static
  assets untouched.
- `apps/web/lib/api.ts`: `apiFetch` wrapper (`cache: "no-store"`); all 22
  call sites migrated; `lib/auth.ts` logout fetch no-store. No
  application-managed response caches exist client-side (verified: the
  only prior no-store was dashboard/page.tsx; no module-level caches).

#### Acceptance evidence

- Backend tests `tests/test_1101_private_response_cache.py` (9): default
  boundary on /me (200 auth + unauth), representative sensitive endpoints,
  health/version not public; SSE preservation; middleware never overrides
  route-set Cache-Control; Vary merge + `Vary: *`; replay regression — a
  shared cache with worst-case URL-only keys can never store account A's
  response nor replay it to account B or post-logout.
- Frontend tests `__tests__/private-cache-no-store.test.ts` (4): requestJson/
  fetchMe/clearAuth send no-store + static guard (zero raw `await fetch(`
  in api.ts).
- Live header verification (local): direct FastAPI :8123 → /api/v1/me 200
  `private, no-store, max-age=0` + Pragma + Expires + Vary; /health same;
  SSE stream 200 `no-cache, no-transform`. Via Next dev :3123
  /proxy/api/v1/me → upstream no-store headers pass through intact.
- Regression: backend 3,459 passed / 1 xfailed; frontend vitest 728/728;
  `npm run build` clean.

#### Remaining verification (preview/production — close gate items)

- Vercel edge behavior for the `/proxy` headers block on an actual
  deployment (next dev does not apply custom headers to external-rewrite
  paths; Vercel's production edge does — the same layer that injected the
  old `public, max-age=0` default). Verify on the PR preview URL:
  Cache-Control + CDN-Cache-Control on `/proxy/api/v1/me`, HIT/MISS
  behavior, then on ricohunt.com after merge+deploy.

### TASK-20260719-013 — analytics record_event malformed-input hardening (audit gates 1-2)

> Canonical-ID note (2026-07-19 sync): originally recorded as 011; the
> owner's canonical map assigns 011 → #1193, 012 → #1194, 013 → #1195.

Status: verified — **MERGED (#1195, `bd378c97`)**
Owner: Claude (Fable session; owner autonomy grant 2026-07-19 — closes the
ACTIVE gap recorded in TASK-20260719-002's post-merge audit)
Branch: claude/growth-lifecycle-automation-qiyzw6
Issue/PR: #1195 (squash `bd378c97`)

#### Objective

Close audit gates 1-2 from the #1176 post-merge audit (verdict B): the
`record_event` "never raises" contract had three empirically confirmed
breaches (non-dict `properties`, non-str `client_event_id`, non-datetime
`occurred_at` — row construction sat outside the `try`), recorded as
ACTIVE once emitters were wired (#1179). Plus the bool-retention hazard
(`purge_expired(True)` → 1-day window, near-total purge).

#### Scope delivered

- `src/repositories/analytics_events_repo.py` — malformed argument TYPES
  rejected fail-closed before any DB access (debug logs never include the
  offending values); row construction moved inside the `try` so residual
  construction errors degrade to the logged skip path (contract is now
  structural, not caller-trust); `_validated_retention_days` rejects bool
  explicitly; docstrings updated to match enforced behavior.
- `tests/unit/test_analytics_events_repo.py` — new section 7 (6 test
  functions / 13 cases): parametrized adversarial types for all three
  arguments; no-value-leak log pin; construction-failure belt-and-braces
  pin; bool purge/count rejection.

#### Explicitly NOT in scope

Allowlist growth policy (gate 3 — owner decision), Render HMAC key
verification (gate 4 — owner-side), emitter changes, migrations, #1177.

#### Rollback

Revert the commit — behavior-narrowing only (inputs that previously
raised now return False; no valid input's behavior changes).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Never-raises pins: three malformed-type families return False with
      zero DB access and zero raised exceptions.
- [x] Privacy pin: rejection logs contain no offending values.
- [x] Structural pin: `_clean_properties` raising inside construction
      degrades to False, never an exception.
- [x] Retention pin: `purge_expired(True/False)` and `count_expired(True)`
      return 0 without DB connection.
- [x] Full analytics suites green: repo 49, emitters 11, purge endpoint
      10 — 69 passed, 1 warning; `py_compile` clean.

##### Addendum — Gate 4 closed: HMAC key live, first production events (2026-07-19)

- Owner added `RICO_ANALYTICS_HMAC_KEY` on Render (owner confirmation
  2026-07-19 ~19:20 UTC; key value never accessed or printed by any agent
  session).
- Empirically verified end-to-end at 19:25:50 UTC (read-only, count/
  aggregate only): production `analytics_events` row count **4** — all
  `search_performed`. First behavioral data in the store; the full chain
  (migration 047 → emitters v1 → keyed HMAC → rows) is proven live in
  production. Baseline collection has begun.
- Remaining open gate from the #1176 post-merge audit: **gate 3 only**
  (additive allowlist-growth migration policy before event #9 — owner
  decision).

### TASK-20260720-004 — Command v5 PR 1: visual foundation (tokens, motion, presence)

Status: done (merged #1242, squash 984edfa; production-deployed via Vercel auto-deploy)
Owner: Claude (agent) / owner review
Branch: claude/command-v5-pr1-visual-foundation
Issue/PR: PR — Command v5 visual foundation (draft)

#### Objective

Ship the approved Command Workspace v5 visual foundation as a self-contained,
unconsumed-by-production module set: AA-audited tokens, typography roles,
surface + motion primitives, RicoPresence indicator, a CI contrast gate, and
an internal gallery specimen — with zero changes to chat logic, APIs,
routing behavior, or backend.

#### Context

- Relevant files: apps/web/components/workspace/v5/{tokens.ts,fonts.ts,motion.css,RicoPresence.tsx}; apps/web/scripts/check-contrast-v5.mjs; apps/web/app/design-gallery/command-v5/{page.tsx,_specimen.tsx}; apps/web/**tests**/command-v5-foundation.test.tsx
- Relevant docs: AI_WORKSPACE/COMMAND_V5_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md; design-handoffs/incoming/2026-07-20-command-workspace-v5-cinematic/EVIDENCE.md (visual acceptance reference, commit 69074a8)
- Existing behavior: WORKSPACE_THEME + atelier-kit untouched; /design-gallery is production-blocked via assertInternalPreviewAccess.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: chat logic, APIs, auth, sessions, billing, production routes' rendering, WORKSPACE_THEME, atelier-kit values.
- No migrations unless explicitly required: none.
- Keep scope limited to: foundation modules + internal specimen + gates + docs.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Every v5 color token AA-gated (scripts/check-contrast-v5.mjs, 19 pairs PASS)
- [x] motion.css ↔ tokens.ts drift guard in vitest
- [x] RicoPresence: 5 states × 3 sizes, status semantics, decorative mode, reduced-motion collapse
- [x] Specimen renders at /design-gallery/command-v5 (internal-only, 404 in production)
- [x] No production route renders differently (no imports from production code)

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: vitest run (full suite)
- [ ] Integration tests: n/a (no behavior surface)
- [x] Frontend build: npm run build
- [x] Local smoke: next start + Playwright screenshots of the specimen (desktop/mobile/reduced-motion)
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke if applicable: n/a (gallery is production-blocked)

### TASK-20260720-005 — Command v5 PR 2: workspace shell skin

Status: done (merged #1243, squash 7b40b70; production-deployed via Vercel auto-deploy)
Owner: Claude (agent) / owner review
Branch: claude/command-v5-pr2-workspace-shell
Issue/PR: PR — Command v5 workspace shell (opened from this task)

#### Objective

Apply the approved v5 visual language to the shared WorkspaceShell chrome
(light island only): per-route accents, rail energy marker, ember wordmark,
route atmosphere, document entrance, Rico presence — preserving all shell
behavior and the dark island untouched.

#### Context

- Relevant files: apps/web/components/workspace/{WorkspaceShell.tsx,RailGoalMini.tsx}; apps/web/app/design-gallery/command-v5-shell/*; apps/web/**tests**/command-v5-shell.test.tsx
- Relevant docs: AI_WORKSPACE/COMMAND_V5_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md (PR 2 row)
- Existing behavior: single-shell ruling (2026-07-18); WORKSPACE_NAV as nav source of truth; fail-hidden mission summary.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: chat behavior, APIs, auth, sessions, routing behavior, dark-island palette.
- No migrations unless explicitly required: none.
- Keep scope limited to: shell chrome skin + specimen + tests + docs.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Active nav: aria-current preserved + v5 energy marker + AA accent text (light)
- [x] Rico presence in shell controls with status semantics (localized label)
- [x] Route atmosphere light-only; dark island byte-identical accents
- [x] Document entrance collapses under reduced motion (v5 primitives)
- [x] All existing shell/nav/count contracts green without weakening

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: vitest 845/845
- [ ] Integration tests: n/a
- [x] Frontend build: PASS
- [x] Local smoke: next start + Playwright (specimen light/dark/mobile/drawer + public /command unchanged)

### TASK-20260720-006 — Audit/reliability delivery closure (merge, verify, hand over)

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed
Branch: n/a (closure across existing PRs)
Issue/PR: #1231 #1232 #1233 #1234 #1235 #1236 #1239 #1240 #1244 #1246 (all merged); #1237 reconciliation is this closure's own PR

#### Objective

Close the 2026-07-20 audit delivery: merge every approved fix one at a time
with exact-head CI and verified rollback, finish the #1239 QA-stability
dependency (test-side #1244 + product-side #1246), reconcile the audit
record, and verify production.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] All approved audit fixes merged sequentially (squash SHAs in the audit closure table)
- [x] QA blocker root-caused and fixed both sides, regression proven fail-pre/pass-post
- [x] Audit record reconciled to actual merged state (AUDITS/2026-07-20-full-system-audit.md)
- [x] AI_WORKSPACE statuses reflect reality (004/005 done; no stale review entries)

### TASK-20260721-001 — System audit: test-truth repair (thread-racing mock leak + stale pre-#354 apply tests) + dead-tool inventory

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-requested ad-hoc audit
Branch: claude/system-tools-analysis-wc4o4g
Issue/PR: #1256 (merged 2026-07-21, squash 6111fa21)

#### Objective

Audit the system for errors, designed-but-never-executed tools, and anomalies;
repair only what is test/docs-safe; record everything destructive as
owner-gated recommendations.

#### Context

- Relevant files: tests/test_jotform_webhook.py, tests/test_agent.py,
  src/agent/workflow/coordinator.py, src/agent/identity/resolver.py,
  src/agent/coordinator.py, src/services/stateful_chat_adapter.py,
  .github/workflows/qa-tests.yml
- Relevant docs: AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-07-21-system-audit-dead-tools-import-breakage.md
  (full findings F1–F5), AI_WORKSPACE/RICO_CODEBASE_INVENTORY_2026_06_21.md
- Existing behavior: production import path clean; stateful-agent stack fails
  at import (5 never-implemented repo symbols + missing
  WorkflowResult.confirmation_token); jotform concurrency test leaked a
  session-wide MagicMock via thread-unsafe patch; 3 test_agent.py tests
  asserted pre-#354 trust-gate behavior, invisible because qa-tests.yml does
  not run that file.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: any runtime/production code, env vars, migrations, workflows
- No migrations unless explicitly required: none
- Keep scope limited to: tests + AI_WORKSPACE docs

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Concurrency test patches applied once from the main thread (leak eliminated)
- [x] 3 apply-link tests pin the current #354 trust-gate contract
- [x] Focused 5-file set deterministic: 5 consecutive runs, 228/228
- [x] Audit handoff records dead stack + broken scripts + CI coverage gap

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: focused set 228/228 x5 local; PR CI pytest/postgres/playwright/frontend/guards all green on 730b154
- [ ] Integration tests: covered by PR CI (postgres-integration green)
- [ ] Frontend build: green in PR CI (no frontend files changed)
- [ ] Local smoke: n/a — test-only + docs
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke if applicable: n/a — nothing deployable changed

### TASK-20260721-002 — Remove the import-broken stateful-agent stack + broken legacy scripts (audit F1/F2)

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-approved removal ("احذف" 2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/system-tools-analysis-wc4o4g (restarted from main 23a1138)
Issue/PR: #1260 (merged 2026-07-21, squash 26b87a04)

#### Objective

Delete the dead, import-broken stateful-agent stack and two broken legacy
scripts identified by the 2026-07-21 system audit (handoff F1/F2), with a
retirement banner on the design doc.

#### Context

- Relevant docs: AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-07-21-system-audit-dead-tools-import-breakage.md;
  AI_WORKSPACE/RICO_CODEBASE_INVENTORY_2026_06_21.md (recommended retirement)
- Existing behavior: all six targets failed at import on main; nothing in
  production or tests imports them (verified by repo-wide grep + import-scan)

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: src/agent/{runtime,orchestrator,registry,tools,context,
  intelligence,responses,response_builder}, any live route or service
- Keep scope limited to: deletion of the six dead targets + doc banner + ledger

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] src/agent/identity/, src/agent/workflow/, src/agent/coordinator.py,
      src/services/stateful_chat_adapter.py, src/linkedin_demo.py,
      src/test_refactored_system.py removed
- [x] Repo-wide grep: no remaining code references to the removed modules
- [x] Import-scan of src/: 0 failures (was 8 on main)
- [x] Focused test set still green
- [x] PR CI green on exact head (9/9 on d06a3d9)

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: focused 5-file set green post-deletion
- [ ] Integration tests: PR CI (postgres-integration)
- [ ] Frontend build: PR CI (no frontend change)
- [ ] Local smoke: n/a — deleted code was unreachable and un-importable
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke if applicable: deploy triggers on src/** — verify

### TASK-20260721-003 — Add the focused backend test set to qa-tests.yml (audit F4 follow-up)

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-approved ("ضم" 2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/system-tools-analysis-wc4o4g (restarted from main 26b87a04)
Issue/PR: #1261 (merged 2026-07-21, squash b9dc8ae2)

#### Objective

Close the CI coverage gap found by the 2026-07-21 audit (F4): tests/
test_agent.py, test_agent_runtime.py, test_jotform_webhook.py,
test_jwt_user_isolation.py, test_onboarding_state.py were never run in CI,
which is how the stale pre-#354 tests and the thread-racing mock leak stayed
invisible. Add all five to the qa-tests.yml pytest job.

#### Constraints

- Keep scope limited to: .github/workflows/qa-tests.yml + ledger
- Do not touch: runtime code, other workflows

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Five files added to the pytest job selection
- [x] Full new CI selection verified locally under CI-identical env vars
      (REDIS_URL="", fake DATABASE_URL, test JWT): 4519 passed, 1 xfailed
- [x] PR CI green on exact head (9/9 on fdb93ab, pytest ran the 5 new files)

### TASK-20260721-004 — Bilingual (AR/EN) intent detection for the agent NL path

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed ("حسّن منطق ريكو ارفع من كفاءته" 2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/system-tools-analysis-wc4o4g (restarted from main ba52549)
Issue/PR: #1266 (merged 2026-07-21, squash 91f27c5b)

#### Objective

Close a single-language-path defect in Rico's live logic: the deterministic
intent detector behind POST /api/v1/agent/chat (src/agent/orchestrator/
intent_detector.py) matched English keywords only, so every Arabic message
fell to the "help" fallback — prohibited by the Product Generalization Rule
("Do not special-case: one language path").

#### Context

- Live path: routers/agent.py → orchestrator.process → detect()
- The canonical rico_chat path is already bilingual; only this NL surface was
  English-only.

#### Constraints

- Keep scope limited to: intent_detector.py + tests + ledger
- Do not touch: ACTION_TO_TOOL, PRIVILEGED_TOOLS semantics, orchestrator flow

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Arabic keywords for all four NL intents, same first-match precedence
- [x] Orthography normalization (tashkeel/tatweel stripped; أ/إ/آ/ٱ→ا, ة→ه,
      ى→ي, ؤ→و, ئ→ي) applied symmetrically to message AND table keywords
      (keywords normalized at module load — no representation drift possible)
- [x] English behavior byte-for-byte unchanged (existing tests untouched, green)
- [x] Arabic tests: every intent, hamza/taa-marbuta variants, full tashkeel,
      colloquial no-hamza spelling, unrelated→help, trigger-vs-status ordering
- [x] PR CI green on exact head (9/9 on 0d36e3c, incl. the 14 Arabic cases)

- Files intentionally not touched: src/rico_chat_api.py (already bilingual),
  orchestrator.py, runtime.py
- What is complete: implementation + local verification (93/93 test_agent;
  252/252 focused set incl. privileged-authz)
- What is incomplete: nothing
- Known blockers: none
- Validation already run: focused set + privileged authz under CI env → 252 passed
- Validation still required: none
- Deployment/CI/Neon/Vercel state to check next: none — Deploy Render Backend
  for 91f27c5b verified success (/version-gated); production live on the
  bilingual detector
- Next exact action: none — task fully closed
- Stop condition: any English-intent regression in CI → fix before merge
- Rollback plan: revert the PR; detector returns to English-only matching

### TASK-20260721-005 — Command v5 PR 3: live modes (Overview / Applications / Documents)

Status: review (Draft PR opened from branch claude/command-v5-pr3-live-modes)
Owner: Claude (agent) / owner review
Branch: claude/command-v5-pr3-live-modes
Issue/PR: PR — Command v5 PR 3 live modes (opened from this task)

#### Objective

PIVOTED 2026-07-21 (owner instruction: "cancel the repo design entirely and
apply the attachment"): PR #1271 now applies the owner-supplied Command
Workspace artifact design — full palette swap (LIGHT + DARK), artifact fonts
(Inter / IBM Plex Mono / Amiri / IBM Plex Sans Arabic; Fraunces stays),
artifact MODE_THEME accents + bilingual hero language on the three live
modes, artifact rail/brand/ambience on WorkspaceShell — replacing the
earlier v5-rebuild palette everywhere it lived. Real data and contracts
only. `/command` chat surface styling remains the next step (PR 4 slot).
Interview/Learning/Activity stay hidden (no production capability).

#### Context

- Relevant files: apps/web/components/workspace/DashboardAtelier.tsx; apps/web/components/applications/ApplicationsAtelier.tsx; apps/web/components/upload/UploadAtelier.tsx; apps/web/components/workspace/theme.ts
- Relevant docs: AI_WORKSPACE/COMMAND_V5_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md (PR 3 row)
- Existing behavior: all data derivations, API calls, status taxonomy, translation keys, testids, aria contracts pinned by dashboard-atelier / flow-manual-application / upload-shell-composition tests.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: data logic, APIs, auth, routing, translation keys, dark-island palette, /command chat surface.
- No migrations unless explicitly required: none.
- Keep scope limited to: presentation of the three mode components + additive `dark` flag on WorkspacePalette.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] v5 mode accents/typography/surfaces on the three modes (light island only); dark island keeps its existing language
- [x] All loading/error/empty states restyled without weakening (skeletons + presence orb are additive; roles/testids unchanged)
- [x] Accent-colored text uses AA text-safe tokens only (modeAText / onEmber)
- [x] EN + AR RTL verified with screenshots; mobile no-overflow proven by e2e
- [x] All existing behavior contracts green without weakening

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: vitest 854/854
- [ ] Integration tests: n/a
- [x] Frontend build: PASS; lint identical to main baseline (0 new findings); check:contrast:v5 PASS
- [x] Local smoke: Playwright single-shell + mobile-usability 18/18 on chromium; screenshots desktop/mobile/AR captured from mocked synthetic data

### TASK-20260722-001 — Atelier Arabic copy: rewrite translated-feeling strings to native Arabic

Status: review
Owner: Claude (agent)
Branch: fix/atelier-arabic-copy-native
Issue/PR: #1276

#### Objective

Review the Arabic strings used by Atelier/command surfaces (`translations.ts` and the Atelier console gallery content) and replace the most obviously translated/literal phrasing with natural, written-for-Arabic copy that matches Rico's UAE/GCC career-assistant tone (modern fus7a, warm, professional). No behavior or layout changes.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `apps/web/lib/translations.ts`; `apps/web/components/design-gallery/atelier-console/rico-content.ts`
- Relevant docs: `AI_WORKSPACE/COMMAND_V5_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md`; strategy PR #1269 chapter 9 (Arabic-written-first)
- Existing behavior: Arabic strings exist and render correctly in RTL; some are literal translations of English labels (e.g., "ثغرات بصراحة", "تخطَّ", "تحديد كمتقدّم") rather than natural Arabic UI copy.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: layout, CSS, tokens, routing, behavior, non-Arabic strings, backend/API code.
- No migrations or env changes.
- Keep scope limited to: Arabic copy refinement in the two translation/content files above.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Most visibly translated Atelier/command labels rephrased to native Arabic.
- [x] English meanings preserved (no semantic drift).
- [x] Gallery specimen content (`rico-content.ts`) aligned with production translation tone.
- [x] Frontend build passes.
- [x] Existing vitest/tests green (updated hardcoded Arabic save-label assertion).

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `npm run test` from `apps/web` — 83/83 files, 854/854 tests passed
- [ ] Integration tests: n/a
- [x] Frontend build: `npm run build` from `apps/web` — green
- [ ] Local smoke: visual spot-check of /command and /applications in AR — owner PR review
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke if applicable: n/a

### TASK-20260721-006 — Command artifact design PR 4: public /command chat surface

Status: review (Draft PR from branch claude/command-v5-pr4-chat-surface)
Owner: Claude (agent) / owner review
Branch: claude/command-v5-pr4-chat-surface
Issue/PR: PR — public /command artifact chrome (opened from this task)

#### Objective

Extend the merged artifact design (#1271) to the PUBLIC /command guest
surface. Technique: the repo's established channel-variable remap
(AtelierCardScope precedent) applied at the guest chrome root —
`publicCommandArtifactVars()` remaps every channel token (bg/surface/gold/
text tiers/aura + the Atelier editorial layer) to the artifact workspace
palettes, following the existing global light/dark toggle (dark stays the
production default; both faces are artifact faces). The authenticated
/command already repainted via #1271's WORKSPACE_THEME swap.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: chat behavior, streaming, attachments, safety, session flow,
  auth gating, translation keys, testids.
- Keep scope limited to: presentation (channel remap + literal color-class
  swaps: navy-on-gold labels → white-on-sun (AA 4.85), amber glow literals
  removed, MobileCommandHeader drawer literals → channel tokens).

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Guest /command wears the artifact palette in BOTH themes with zero markup/behavior change
- [x] Sun-button labels AA (white on sun ≥4.85; fixes the pre-existing dark-on-sun user bubble post-#1271)
- [x] Mobile drawer follows the artifact palette (no hardcoded navy)
- [x] All existing behavior contracts green without weakening

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: vitest 854/854
- [x] Frontend build: PASS; lint identical to main baseline (0 new findings)
- [x] Local smoke: Playwright single-shell + mobile-usability 18/18; guest light/dark/mobile/drawer screenshots reviewed
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke if applicable: after merge via Vercel auto-deploy

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260721-006
- GitHub issue/PR: PR — public /command artifact chrome
- Branch: claude/command-v5-pr4-chat-surface
- Base branch: main (4b33709)

- Known pre-existing issue (NOT from this PR): dev-only hydration warning for the theme-toggle sun/moon icon when a guest has rico-theme=light stored (icon depends on client-only theme state; predates this change)
- Next exact action: owner review of the Draft PR
- Rollback plan: revert the PR — presentation-only diff

### TASK-20260721-007 — Profile avatar + measured performance slice (post-design program)

Status: done (both merged and live)
Owner: Claude (agent) / owner approvals in-session

#### Delivered

1. Profile avatar (#1279, squash f6c0d84): /api/v1/user/avatar GET/POST/DELETE,
   dedicated user_avatars table (migration 050 — APPLIED to production Neon and
   verified via to_regclass BEFORE merge), ProfileAvatar hero UI with client-side
   downscale; drift-check signature added. Render deploy for f6c0d84: success
   (SHA-gated).
2. Perf slice 1 (#1282, squash 902c820): Arabic font families preload:false;
   dead global IBM Plex Sans moved route-scoped to the design gallery.
   Lighthouse 12 mobile: landing 66→90 (LCP 5.1→3.6s); guest /command 72→80
   (LCP 10.3→5.4s, font bytes 950→552 KB).
3. Perf slice 2 (JS split of react-markdown) — implemented, MEASURED, REJECTED:
   route JS 87.5→43 KB but LCP 5.4→~9s across three clean-server runs (the
   welcome message is the LCP element; the lazy swap delays its final paint).
   Fully reverted; no PR. Recorded so the next optimizer doesn't repeat it.
4. Chat-quality branch #1278 closed as superseded by #1277 (deeper root-cause:
   hardcoded Gulf-dialect runtime rule); its superior deterministic pieces were
   harvested into main by the owner-side follow-up (0665312f).

#### Production verification (this task's closure)

- Render: deploy-render success on 0665312f (latest backend-relevant main).
- SMOKE-1197 + Delivery-Smoke: dispatched on main — results recorded in the
  session report.

### TASK-20260721-008 — Atomic Postgres operation-ownership store (stabilization slice 1)

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed ("اعمل اللازم" 2026-07-21 — first
stabilization slice per DEC-20260721-001)
Branch: claude/ricco-research-improvements-dkmhin (restarted from main 963ba2e)
Issue/PR: #1285 (merged 2026-07-21, squash 7497c2a3; "Deploy Render Backend"
for 7497c2a3 = success, /version-gated). NOTE: originally ledgered as
TASK-20260721-007 inside #1285; renumbered to -008 here to resolve a same-day
ID collision with the profile-avatar task entry above.

#### Objective

Move chat job-search operation ownership from the in-process
process-nonce model (safe ONLY single-instance/single-worker — pinned by
test_concurrent_foreign_process_would_release_ownership_UNSAFE_for_multiworker)
to an atomic shared Postgres store: table `chat_operations` (migration 051 —
renumbered from 050 on 2026-07-21; 050 stays with user_avatars, the older reference),
row-lock-serialized claims, heartbeat-lease liveness (renewal thread; missed
lease = proof of executor death), SQL-enforced attempt fence, and an
atomic-claim refusal path so a losing racer never runs a duplicate provider
cascade. Migration 051 (chat_operations + idx_chat_operations_user_latest)
is APPLIED — verified read-only on production Neon 2026-07-21 (#1299
evidence: to_regclass PRESENT for both) — so the Postgres store is ACTIVE
in production. Scaling workers/instances stays BLOCKED until slice-4
validation passes.

#### Scope

- migrations/050_chat_operations.sql (new, idempotent, additive; renamed
  to 051_chat_operations.sql on 2026-07-21 — identity is now 051)
- src/repositories/chat_operations_repo.py (new)
- src/services/operation_state.py (dual backend: postgres + memory fallback;
  RICO_OPERATION_STORE=auto|postgres|memory, default auto)
- src/rico_chat_api.py (claim-refusal → honest in-progress reply; no
  history/analytics; never mark_failed on an unowned operation)
- scripts/check_migration_drift.py (chat_operations signature objects — now under id 051)
- tests/conftest.py (suite-wide memory-backend default)
- tests/unit/test_operation_duplicate_guard.py (docstrings rescoped to the
  memory fallback)
- tests/integration/test_operation_ownership_postgres.py (new — proves the
  multi-worker-safety property on real Postgres)

#### Continuity Block

- Current head SHA: 7497c2a3 (main after squash merge of #1285)
- Status: done — merged + deployed (Deploy Render Backend success for
  7497c2a3, /version-gated); CI on final PR head 5ae19599 was 9/9 green
  (pytest, postgres-integration, frontend, playwright, guards, Neon)
- Validation already run: py_compile; tests/unit 3,433 passed (incl. 37
  operation-focused + drift checks after fix); focused canonical set 245
  passed; operation-adjacent root tests 47 passed; NEW postgres integration
  8/8 passed against a real local Postgres 16; full tests/integration run:
  117 passed + 4 PRE-EXISTING failures in
  test_jotform_webhook_to_chat_flow.py::TestPublicChatWithEmail (reproduced
  identically on pre-change code via git stash — unrelated to this task)
- Validation still required: CI pytest + postgres-integration on the PR head
- Deployment: migration (applied while numbered 050; reference identity now
  051) is PRESENT in production Neon — verified read-only 2026-07-21
  (to_regclass: chat_operations + idx_chat_operations_user_latest both
  PRESENT). The Postgres store is therefore ACTIVE. Renaming the file does
  not and cannot un-apply the object; the drift guard checks object
  presence, not filenames. Worker/instance count is NOT changed by this task.
- Known blockers: none
- Risks: DB unavailability falls back to legacy semantics (documented;
  logged); heartbeat thread is daemon + self-terminating on terminal/supersede
- Rollback plan: revert the PR (fallback path is the current production
  behavior); migration 051 may stay applied (additive) or be dropped with
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS chat_operations
- Next exact action: none — migration applied and Postgres store active
  (verified 2026-07-21). Workers/instances stay at 1 (BLOCKED) until
  slice-4 multi-worker validation passes.
- Stop condition: met — merged and deployed; no further writes on this task

### TASK-20260721-005 — Bilingual (AR/EN) agent replies — response builder localization

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed ("استمر بما يعود بالفائدة الأكبر على المنتج" 2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/system-tools-analysis-wc4o4g (restarted from main 247e83a)
Issue/PR: #1288 (merged 2026-07-21, squash c626521f)

#### Objective

Complete the bilingual agent path opened by TASK-20260721-004: after #1266 an
Arabic user's intent executes, but every reply, action label, and UI title
came back in English (src/agent/response_builder/response_builder.py is the
sole AgentUIResponse producer). Localize all reply templates so the reply
language follows the user's message language.

#### Constraints

- Keep scope limited to: response_builder.py + tests + ledger
- Do not touch: action `type` values, tool names, data payloads, UI type enums
- English output must remain byte-for-byte identical for non-Arabic messages

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Language detection from the user's message (Arabic block regex); empty/
      button-driven requests default to English (existing behavior)
- [x] Arabic templates for every builder: job list, apply/skip/save/block,
      stats, pipeline status/trigger, market, strategy, learning profile,
      help, error — messages, action labels, and UI titles
- [x] English strings byte-identical (existing tests untouched and green)
- [x] 7 new tests incl. end-to-end: Arabic NL message → intent → tool →
      Arabic reply through orchestrator.process
- [x] CI green on exact head: qa-tests full suite via workflow_dispatch on
      2c8ca71 and db8b12a (GitHub-linked to #1288; pull_request event delivery
      failed that hour — dispatched runs are the evidence)

### TASK-20260721-009 — Admin operations observability endpoint (stabilization slice 2)

Status: done — #1293 merged 2026-07-21 (squash 2ed5cee7); "Deploy Render
Backend" for 2ed5cee7 = success (/version-gated). chat_operations (id 051,
applied while numbered 050) is PRESENT in production — verified read-only
2026-07-21 — so the operations section reports available=true (store
active); confirm visually at the next owner admin smoke.
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed ("تمام باشر" 2026-07-21 — slice 2 per
DEC-20260721-001: monitoring for errors, costs, stuck operations)
Branch: claude/ricco-research-improvements-dkmhin (restarted from main b8379d7)
Issue/PR: (opens with this branch's new PR)

#### Objective

Give the owner one read-only, admin-gated snapshot of operational health:
GET /api/v1/admin/ops/overview — stuck/pending chat operations (heartbeat-
lease view over the slice-1 shared store: running, timed_out,
stuck_lease_dead, oldest active age), 24h/7d search volume + failure counts
(the honest error/cost proxies available today), job-provider degradation
state (existing provider_health()), AI-provider readiness (strict boolean
allowlist over RicoEnvReport), and process-local chat-API counters.
Explicitly deferred (later increments): per-token AI spend counters
(needs provider instrumentation) and any alerting/cron trigger.

#### Scope

- src/api/routers/admin_ops.py (new; require_admin-gated; read-only)
- src/api/app.py (router registration — 2 lines)
- src/repositories/chat_operations_repo.py (stats() aggregate, read-only)
- tests/unit/test_admin_ops_overview.py (new — 5 tests: authz wiring,
  unauthenticated rejection, snapshot shape, honest store-degradation
  reporting, ai_provider strict allowlist)
- tests/integration/test_operation_ownership_postgres.py (+ stats test)
- AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md (this entry; -008 closure; ID-collision renumber)

#### Continuity Block

- Current head SHA: (set at commit)
- Status: in_review — PR opens as draft; merge is owner-gated
- Validation already run: py_compile; new unit file 5/5; postgres
  integration 9/9 (incl. new stats test) on local Postgres 16; full
  tests/unit 3,434 passed after the app.py router registration
- Validation still required: CI pytest + postgres-integration on PR head
- Deployment: additive read-only endpoint; no schema change, no migration;
  chat_operations (id 051) verified PRESENT in production 2026-07-21, so
  the operations section is live (available=true, store active)
- Known blockers: none
- Risks: none material — endpoint is read-only, admin-gated, value-free
  (booleans/counts/enum strings; no key values, user identifiers, or query
  text)
- Rollback plan: revert the PR — no schema or behavior dependency
- Next exact action: open draft PR, CI green, owner review/merge
- Stop condition: any CI regression → fix before merge; no alerting/cron
  surface in this slice

### TASK-20260721-010 — Core-path real-wrapper contract tests (stabilization slice 3)

Status: in_review
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed ("افعل ما تراه مناسباً" 2026-07-21 —
slice 3 per DEC-20260721-001: pin chat/search/save/apply contracts with
tests that run through the REAL paths)
Branch: claude/ricco-research-improvements-dkmhin (restarted from latest main)
Issue/PR: (opens with this branch's new PR)

#### Objective

Generalize the #1166→#1169 lesson (endpoint tests that patch the router's
own wrapper hide router↔wrapper kwarg drift — the class that shipped the
production save outage) to the remaining core paths:

- Chat: POST /api/v1/rico/chat runs the REAL chat_service.send_message with
  a capturing spy only one layer down (_legacy_send_message) — proves
  ctx/message/operation_id/language bind and SURVIVE router → service →
  dispatch (the transport contract the duplicate-execution guard depends
  on), plus JWT-only identity and 401 on the real path.
- Save/apply actions: POST /api/v1/actions/run executes the REAL
  agent_runtime.handle_action with ZERO runtime mocks, using the runtime's
  own dry_run log-only mode — proves the router's handle_action(...) kwarg
  contract, ActionResult→ActionResponse serialization, unknown-action
  controlled refusal (200 ok=false, not 500), the _approved-sentinel strip,
  and 401 unauthenticated.
- Search: deep chain already runs real in test_operation_duplicate_guard +
  the postgres ownership suite; this slice pins the transport contract that
  feeds it (documented in the test module docstring).

#### Scope

- tests/test_core_path_real_wrappers.py (new — 9 tests; TEST-ONLY change,
  no src/ modification)
- AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md (this entry; -009 closure)

#### Continuity Block

- Current head SHA: (set at commit)
- Status: in_review — PR opens as draft; merge is owner-gated

### TASK-20260721-011 — Launch-readiness reconciliation report (owner: "هل المنتج جاهز للنشر")

Status: review
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed ("تفضل" 2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/system-tools-analysis-wc4o4g (restarted from main 0b94c55)
Issue/PR: set at PR open

#### Objective

Answer the owner's launch-readiness question with a fact-based control-plane
reconciliation: live snapshot, LAUNCH_EXECUTION_PLAN gate status, full open-PR
triage (15), route matrix, new anomalies, and a numbered owner decision list.

#### Deliverable

AI_WORKSPACE/LAUNCH_READINESS_2026-07-21.md — verdict: LIVE STABLE OPEN BETA,
not commercially launch-ready; blockers are owner decisions (billing activation,
rotation confirmation, PR dispositions, invitations, owner smoke, legal
sign-off), not missing code.

#### Notable findings recorded

- Duplicate migration number 050 in main (chat_operations + user_avatars)
- #1177 would collide on migration 047 (analytics_events already in main)
- PROJECT_STATUS snapshot still 2026-07-18 — superseded for readiness purposes
  by this report; refresh to ride the next control-plane docs PR

### TASK-20260721-012 — Renumber duplicate migration 050: chat_operations → 051

Status: done
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed single-item execution (2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/system-tools-analysis-wc4o4g (restarted from main fdb4ff3c, contains #1297)
Issue/PR: #1299 (owner-merged 2026-07-21, squash 5e03ec48, after owner review
fix 9000b78 — ledger contradiction corrected)

#### Objective

Remove the duplicate migration number 050 (readiness report §5.1):
050_user_avatars (#1279, 11:45) and 050_chat_operations (#1285, 13:40)
collided. Decision per owner rule (applied-first / older-reference):
user_avatars keeps 050; chat_operations renumbered to 051 (next free —
verified no 051 reference existed anywhere).

#### Evidence gathered before changing anything

- Read-only Neon production check (project robenjob): user_avatars PRESENT,
  chat_operations PRESENT, idx_chat_operations_user_latest PRESENT — BOTH
  are applied, so the older-reference criterion decided the keeper. No SQL
  was executed beyond SELECT to_regclass.
- Drift guard checks OBJECT PRESENCE, not filenames, and there is no
  filename-based migration ledger — the rename is DB-neutral by design.
- scripts/apply_migration_drift.py: no 050/chat_operations references.

#### Atomic change set

- migrations/050_chat_operations.sql → 051_chat_operations.sql (git rename,
  97% similarity; only the header number line changed — SQL body untouched)
- scripts/check_migration_drift.py: both chat_operations entries 050 → 051
  - renumber note in the comment
- src/services/operation_state.py, src/repositories/chat_operations_repo.py,
  tests/unit/test_operation_duplicate_guard.py: comment references 050 → 051
- tests/integration/test_operation_ownership_postgres.py:_MIGRATION file
  path updated (functional reference)
- NEW tests/unit/test_migration_numbering.py: (1) unique numeric prefixes,
  (2) every drift-guard CHECKS id maps to an existing migration file
- AI_WORKSPACE: TASKS prose for TASK-008/-009 updated to 051;
  LAUNCH_READINESS §5.1 marked RESOLVED

#### Proofs (rule 6)

- [x] Fail-before: test_migration_numbers_are_unique FAILED on pre-fix tree
      with {'050': ['050_chat_operations.sql', '050_user_avatars.sql']}
- [x] Pass-after: 2/2 numbering tests; drift-guard ids unique
      (005…050,051); chat_operations → 051 entries, user_avatars → 050
- [x] No runtime/schema change: rename similarity 97% (header line only);
      all other code edits are comments + one test path constant
- [x] Broad run: tests/unit/ + test_agent + test_agent_runtime +
      test_avatar_endpoints — 3605 passed
- [x] Full PR CI green on both heads (5e6a71e: 13/13; review-fix 9000b78:
      gating pull_request run fully green)

### TASK-20260721-013 — SSRF DNS fail-open remediation in link_verifier (LOW-3)

Status: done — #1302 merged 2026-07-21 (squash 7b8df097); "Deploy Render
Backend" for 7b8df097 = success (/version-gated). Live in production: any
URL with an unresolvable hostname is rejected on both the sync and async
SSRF paths.
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed (LOW-3 remediation 2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/ricco-research-improvements-dkmhin (restarted from main 46bdd32)
Issue/PR: #1302 (merged, deploy verified 7b8df097)

#### Objective

Close the DNS fail-OPEN in src/services/link_verifier.py's SSRF guard. Both
_is_safe_url_async and_is_safe_url_sync caught EVERY DNS-resolution error
and returned True ("allow URL but note limitation") — so any URL whose
hostname failed to resolve (NXDOMAIN, resolver error, timeout, or a
rebinding attempt racing the check) bypassed the private-range/metadata
guard entirely. Fix: on getaddrinfo failure, return False (fail closed),
identically on both paths.

Acceptance: no URL with an unresolvable hostname can pass the SSRF check on
the sync OR async path.

#### Scope (narrow — LOW-3 only)

- src/services/link_verifier.py: the two DNS-failure `except Exception`
  blocks change `pass` (→ fall through to `return True`) into `return False`.
  NOTHING ELSE changed — protocol allow-list, private/metadata ranges,
  redirect logic, and HTTP fetch are all untouched. No DNS pinning, no
  redesign (explicitly out of scope).
- tests/test_link_verifier_dns_fail_closed.py: NEW regression suite
  (16 tests, deterministic getaddrinfo mocks, no network) — NXDOMAIN,
  generic resolver exception, public→public (allowed), public→private
  (rejected), public→metadata (rejected), sync/async parity across all DNS
  outcomes, and the verify_link caller contract (unresolvable host →
  BLOCKED, no HTTP fetch, no 500).
- AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md (this entry).

#### Caller audit

- src/api/routers/link_verification.py (Pydantic `validate_url` /
  `validate_urls`): call `_is_safe_url` → `_is_safe_url_sync`; a False now
  raises the existing ValueError("URL is not allowed (SSRF protection)") —
  a clean 422, not a 500. Correct.
- src/services/link_verifier.LinkVerifier.verify_link (async, self-protects
  via `_is_safe_url_async` for the initial URL and every redirect target):
  a False now returns LinkStatus.BLOCKED with no HTTP fetch — honest,
  no 500. Pinned by test_verify_link_blocks_unresolvable_host_without_fetch.
- src/rico_chat_api._verify_link_sync → verify_link: inherits the BLOCKED
  result; no bypass path.

#### Continuity Block

- Current head SHA: (set at commit)
- Status: in_review — Draft PR; NO merge, NO deploy, NO LOW-1/LOW-2, NO
  slice-4 (owner stop conditions)
- Validation already run: new suite 16/16 post-fix; PROVEN 7/16 FAIL on
  pre-fix code (git stash of link_verifier.py) — the 7 DNS-failure cases;
  existing tests/test_link_verifier.py + tests/test_354_apply_link_verification.py
  34 passed; py_compile OK
- Validation still required: full CI on the PR head
- Deployment: none in this task — owner-gated
- Known blockers: none
- Risks: a hostname that is genuinely unresolvable at check time is now
  BLOCKED instead of allowed — this is the intended security posture, and a
  fetch of such a host could not have succeeded anyway
- Rollback plan: revert the PR (restores prior fail-open behavior)
- Next exact action: open Draft PR, targeted tests + full CI green, stop
- Stop condition: STOP after evidence report and green CI (owner directive)

### TASK-20260721-014 — Multi-worker readiness: mandatory-Postgres fail-closed + real-process concurrency proof (stabilization slice 4)

Status: in_review — **NOT done; expansion gate REMAINS CLOSED.** Owner review
(2026-07-21) identified an un-eliminated post-claim-partition duplicate-cascade
window (see "Owner-review follow-up" below). Slice 4 is NOT complete and
Render workers/instances MUST stay at 1 until end-to-end cooperative cascade
cancellation lands (a separate follow-up PR).
Owner: Claude (agent), owner-directed (slice 4 per DEC-20260721-001 —
"إثبات وتشديد أمان التشغيل متعدد العمال" 2026-07-21)
Branch: claude/ricco-research-improvements-dkmhin (restarted from main e3a5780)
Issue/PR: #1304 (Draft; head 09b6ab6)

#### Objective

**PARTIAL HARDENING ONLY — slice 4 is NOT complete and the multi-worker
expansion gate stays CLOSED.** Harden the atomic ownership store (slices 1-2,
live in production) and remove the unsafe memory fallback in the mandatory
Postgres mode, backed by real-process evidence. This PR does NOT prove full
multi-worker safety and does NOT raise Render workers/instances: the owner
review exposed an un-eliminated **post-claim-partition duplicate-cascade
window** (a peer can start a SECOND cascade if a DB partition outlasts the
lease while a worker is still executing). **BLOCKER for closing slice 4 /
opening the gate = post-claim partition cascade cancellation** (end-to-end
cooperative cancellation through job_providers/jsearch_client — a separate,
larger follow-up PR). Workers/instances MUST stay at 1 until then.

#### Scope

- src/services/operation_state.py:
  - NEW `OperationStoreUnavailable`; `_mandatory_db()` +
    `_on_repo_unavailable()`. Under RICO_OPERATION_STORE=postgres every store
    op (start/get/get_latest/update) FAILS CLOSED (raises) instead of falling
    back to memory; `auto`/`memory` keep the single-worker memory fallback.
  - Absent-row in mandatory mode returns None (never resurrects memory state).
  - TEST-ONLY lease/heartbeat overrides via `_lease_seconds()` /
    `_heartbeat_interval()`, GATED by `_test_timings_allowed()` (honored only
    when `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` is set; ignored in production). Production
    defaults (60s / 10s) can never be overridden by a stray env var.
  - `build_status_response` returns an honest service_unavailable dict when
    the mandatory store is down.
  - PREPARATORY ownership-loss signal (`ownership_lost()` +
    `_mark_ownership_lost`/`_discard_ownership_loss`): heartbeat self-fences
    when the lease is unrenewable past its window or the row is taken over.
    NO executor consumer yet — it does NOT stop provider calls, so it does
    not reduce the duplicate-cascade window; explicit lifecycle (cleared on
    terminal/restart, FIFO-capped at 2048) prevents unbounded growth. Full
    consumer lands with the cancellation PR.
- src/repositories/chat_operations_repo.py: `claim()` first-insert race fix —
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (operation_id) DO NOTHING RETURNING` + re-SELECT
  FOR UPDATE on conflict. A plain FOR UPDATE does not lock a not-yet-existing
  key, so two workers could both INSERT the same new id → UniqueViolation for
  the loser (exposed by the multiprocessing race). Now the loser is refused
  (or takes over a dead lease), never a 500.
- src/rico_chat_api.py: `process_message` maps OperationStoreUnavailable to an
  honest `service_unavailable` reply (no cascade, no 500); the cleanup
  `mark_failed` is guarded so a store outage during error handling can't mask
  the original error.
- tests/unit/test_operation_store_mandatory_failclosed.py (NEW, 9): mandatory
  mode raises + NEVER touches memory (fail-before via _memory_start assertion),
  auto mode still falls back, mode helpers, honest process_message reply.
- tests/integration/test_operation_multiworker_postgres.py (NEW, 8): REAL
  Postgres + REAL independent processes racing on a Barrier — (1) simultaneous
  race → one claim/one refuse, cascade runs once via the real
  _begin_job_search_operation decision path; (2) live heartbeating owner can't
  be robbed past the lease; (3) dead owner → takeover after lease, attempt→2,
  late attempt=1 write refused; (4) normal completion → heartbeat stops, no
  stuck row, stats clean; (5) mandatory + dead DB before claim → fail closed,
  no cascade, nothing written; (6) two users same id → independent ownership,
  no leak/clobber; (7) admin_ops overview reflects running/stuck/failed;
  (8) **post-claim partition → SECOND cascade runs (counter==2): the OPEN
  window, proven not eliminated.**
- AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md (this entry; TASK-013 closure).

#### Continuity Block

- Current head SHA: 09b6ab6
- Status: in_review — Draft PR; slice 4 NOT complete, gate CLOSED. NO merge by
  agent, NO deploy, NO Render worker/instance change, NO LOW-1/LOW-2, NO daily
  loop (owner stop conditions). Owner may merge as PARTIAL hardening.
- Validation already run: full tests/unit 3,449 passed; multiworker
  integration 8/8 on real local Postgres 16 (fork processes, short lease);
  ownership integration 9/9; mandatory-failclosed 13/13; py_compile OK; CI 9/9
  complete and green on 09b6ab6 (pytest + postgres-integration + frontend +
  playwright + guards + Neon). Fail-before demonstrated for THREE paths:
  mandatory→memory (unit assertion), the claim insert-race (UniqueViolation on
  pre-ON-CONFLICT code), and the post-claim partition duplicate-cascade window
  (the new test asserts a second cascade runs).
- Validation still required: none for this partial-hardening PR.
- Deployment: none. What IS proven safe: simultaneous claim race → one
  cascade; first-insert race fixed; dead worker → safe takeover after lease;
  late stale write refused; mandatory-mode outage BEFORE claim fails closed;
  monitoring truthful. What is NOT: a partition AFTER claim can still start a
  second cascade (open window). Raising workers/instances stays BLOCKED.
- Known blockers: **post-claim-partition duplicate-cascade cancellation** —
  needs end-to-end cooperative cancellation through the provider cascade
  (separate follow-up PR); until it lands the gate stays closed.
- Risks: in mandatory mode a store outage returns 503-style replies instead
  of degrading to memory — intended (correctness over availability under
  multi-worker). `auto` default is unchanged for single-worker today.
- Rollback plan: revert the PR (restores prior fallback + pre-race claim).
- Next exact action: owner review of the corrected PR; decide whether to
  merge as partial hardening. Agent does not merge, does not raise workers.
- Stop condition: STOP after evidence report + green CI (owner directive).

#### Owner-review follow-up (2026-07-21) — addressed on this branch, gate stays CLOSED

Owner review of #1304 (head ee37126e) found two issues; both handled here:

1. **Post-claim DB partition can still start a SECOND cascade (NOT eliminated).**
   In `_start_heartbeat`, a `RepoUnavailable` during a partition can't renew the
   lease; if the outage outlasts the lease a peer takes over and starts a second
   cascade while worker A is still executing. The attempt fence stops A's late
   WRITE but not A's in-flight provider calls. Actions taken:
   - Added a **preparatory self-fence signal** (NOT a duplicate-cascade
     reduction — no executor consumer yet): when the heartbeat is unrenewable
     past the lease (or the row is taken over), the worker marks
     `ownership_lost(op, attempt)` and stops renewing. Explicit lifecycle —
     cleared on terminal/restart via `_discard_ownership_loss`/`_stop_heartbeats`
     and FIFO-capped at `_MAX_LOST_OWNERSHIP` (2048) — so the state cannot leak.
   - Added a REAL-process **fail-before/window test**
     `test_partition_after_claim_starts_second_cascade_window_documented`:
     A claims + partitions + stays alive; after the lease B takes over and a
     SECOND cascade runs (cascade counter == 2); A self-fences; A's attempt=1
     write is refused. The test PROVES the window still exists.
   - **Corrected the claims** everywhere: no "exactly one cascade" in general and
     no "gate criteria all proven". The "one cascade" guarantee is now scoped to
     the simultaneous-claim race and the pre-claim outage only.
   - **Full elimination is deferred to a separate PR**: end-to-end cooperative
     cascade cancellation (checkpoints threaded through job_providers/
     jsearch_client so A stops issuing provider calls the moment it loses the
     lease). Until it lands, workers/instances stay at 1.

2. **Lease/heartbeat overrides were readable in production.** Now gated by
   `_test_timings_allowed()` (honored ONLY when `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` is set —
   an active pytest run; forked children inherit it). A stray
   `RICO_OPERATION_LEASE_SECONDS` in production is IGNORED, so it can never
   shrink the lease to a takeover-racy value. Pinned by
   test_timing_overrides_are_ignored_without_pytest_marker.

Revised head after follow-up: (set at commit). CI: full unit + postgres
integration green on the new head. **No merge, no deploy, no worker/instance
change** (owner stop conditions).

#### Follow-up (2026-07-22, owner-directed) — end-to-end cooperative cancellation (PR #1306, in_review, NOT merged; #1305 frozen, no new TASK ID)

The BLOCKER named above (post-claim-partition duplicate-cascade cancellation)
now has a real executor consumer: the ownership-loss signal is threaded all the
way into the provider HTTP layer, so a de-owned worker stops NEW provider work
and discards any in-flight response without side effects. **This is NOT merged
and NOT deployed — PR #1306 stays a Draft under owner review.**

Guarantee delivered (NOT a claim to abort an already-sent urllib request):
"No new provider work after cancellation becomes observable; any already
in-flight response is discarded without side effects."

Owner review on the first (shallow) implementation raised 8 blocking findings —
the token stopped at `search_jobs` and never reached the provider clients, side
effects (mark_degraded / observations / cache) could fire before the
orchestrator noticed, JSearch backoff was a non-interruptible `time.sleep`,
queued futures were not cancelled, a raising check failed OPEN, and the
acceptance test took ownership_lost as given instead of starting a real cascade
before the partition. All 8 are addressed:

- NEW `src/services/cancellation.py` — dependency-free `CancellationToken`
  (operation_id, attempt, `is_cancelled` callable). job_providers/jsearch_client
  do NOT import operation_state; the token is passed EXPLICITLY down the cascade.
  rico_chat_api binds it to `operation_state.ownership_lost(op, attempt)`.
  **FAIL-CLOSED (finding #6):** a *present* token whose check raises is treated
  as CANCELLED (a broken ownership check cannot license more provider work);
  an ABSENT token stays fail-open (`is_cancelled(None)` is False — unchanged
  compat for every non-cancellable caller).
- `FetchResult.cancelled: bool` — a DISTINCT outcome (`error="ownership_lost"`,
  `provider="none"`), never conflated with no-results / degradation / quota /
  HTTP error.
- **Token threaded into every provider client (findings #1/#2):**
  `_jooble_search`, `_adzuna_search`, `_jsearch_search`, and
  `jsearch_client.search` all accept `cancel=` and check it BEFORE issuing any
  HTTP request and immediately AFTER the response — so `mark_degraded`,
  `_record_observations_safe`, `record_observations`, and cache writes are all
  guarded and never fire for a de-owned in-flight response.
- **Interruptible JSearch backoff (finding #3):** the retry `time.sleep(backoff)`
  is replaced with `_wait_or_cancelled()`, which polls the token every 0.1s and
  starts no new retry once ownership is lost. Stale cache is not served after a
  lost lease.
- **Cache / internal races (finding #5):** `search_jobs` re-checks ownership
  after the cache lookup (before delivering a hit), before and after
  `internal_lookup`, and before `_cache_put`.
- **Mechanical future cancellation (finding #4):** the harvest `finally` now
  calls `fut.cancel()` on every pending future and
  `pool.shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)`, so queued-but-unstarted
  providers never run.
- rico_chat_api: `_current_cancellation_token()` + `_fetch_jobs_with_cancel()`
  (signature-safe for monkeypatched stand-ins). On a cancelled fetch the search
  path returns an honest `search_superseded` reply and records NOTHING — no
  mark_completed, no observations, no results delivered.
- **Privacy (finding #8):** the cancellation log no longer emits the raw
  `operation_id` (which embeds the server-minted guest/session id); it uses the
  new `log_privacy.operation_ref()` HMAC fingerprint.

Evidence (fail-before / pass-after where the finding named a specific gap):

- tests/test_provider_cascade_cancellation.py (10) — entry / before-worker /
  in-flight-discard / distinct-outcome / absent-token / **raising-check
  fail-closed** + cascade-stops / **jooble in-flight records no observations &
  no degradation** / end-to-end real token→real cascade.
- tests/test_jsearch_client.py TestJsearchCancellation (5) — no request at
  entry, no cache delivered when de-owned, **no new retry after ownership lost**,
  **interruptible backoff cut short**, in-flight success writes no cache / no
  observations.
- tests/test_job_providers.py (25) — provider stand-ins updated to the
  `cancel=`-aware signature; hedge/stagger/cache paths unchanged.
- tests/unit/test_job_search_operation_state.py +2 — superseded-no-record;
  token↔ownership_lost binding.
- tests/integration/test_operation_multiworker_postgres.py (9) — the documented
  post-claim-partition WINDOW test is retained, PLUS a new ACCEPTANCE test
  `test_self_fenced_owner_inflight_cascade_cancelled_without_side_effects`:
  under a REAL post-claim Postgres partition, worker A self-fences and its REAL
  in-flight cascade returns cancelled with NO new provider work, NO observations,
  NO degradation, NO cache write, NO winner, NO terminal write.

STILL owner-gated (NOT changed here): raising Render workers/instances and
setting RICO_OPERATION_STORE=postgres in production remain a SEPARATE owner
decision after this lands + is verified. Workers/instances stay 1, the expansion
gate stays CLOSED, #1305 is frozen, and there is NO deploy / env / Render change.
This PR does NOT raise workers, does NOT deploy, and does NOT merge itself.
TASK-014 stays in_review pending owner review of the cancellation consumer and
the gate decision.

### TASK-20260721-015 — Development-control layer: rico-development-supervisor skill + ledger + bounded launcher (rebuilt per owner review of #1305)

Status: in_review
Owner: Claude (session claude/rico-development-supervisor-sfdh8w), owner-directed 2026-07-21
Branch: claude/rico-development-supervisor-sfdh8w (rebuilt from main 0e0497ba after owner review)
Issue/PR: #1305 (Draft)

#### Objective

Add the controlled "Rico Development Supervisor" loop as a development-control
layer ONLY — no Rico runtime behavior change. One invocation = at most ONE
implementation task, max THREE observe/verify correction cycles, hard owner
gates before merge/deploy/DB/secrets/billing/production mutation/destructive
commands/scope expansion, IDLE modifies nothing, conflicting workspace vs
live state stops execution, failed acceptance criteria cannot be reported
complete.

#### History (honesty note)

Attempt 1 (base e3a5780, head 3c8f9f6) failed its own OBSERVE contract: open
PR #1304 was concurrently editing AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md and using
TASK-20260721-014, yet the session claimed no overlap and reused that ID; the
ledger contradicted append-only; result parsing was lax; Read/Edit/Write were
unscoped; no real CLI smoke ran. Recorded as INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE in
DEVELOPMENT_LOOP_STATE.md. This entry is the corrective rebuild under the
next free ID.

#### Scope (control-plane only; no src/, no apps/web runtime code)

- .claude/skills/rico-development-supervisor/SKILL.md — loop contract
  (OBSERVE/DECIDE/ACT/VERIFY/RECORD/STOP-OR-LOOP, 12 hard owner gates,
  strict final-line RICO_SUPERVISOR_RESULT contract) + remediations:
  changed-FILE-LIST overlap inspection, Task-ID uniqueness rule, mandatory
  pre-push revalidation (re-fetch main, re-check overlap/uniqueness, stop
  BLOCKED_CONFLICT without pushing), two-commit append-only ledger pattern,
  launcher main-only precondition, defense-in-depth (not sandbox) wording.
- AI_WORKSPACE/DEVELOPMENT_LOOP_STATE.md — append-only YAML ledger schema v2:
  validated_head_sha (real SHA only, sentinels forbidden), full-diff
  files_changed; attempt 1 recorded as INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE.
- scripts/rico-development-loop.sh — bounded launcher: refuses to start
  unless on clean main == fresh origin/main; strict result parser (single
  exact-format result line that must be the last non-empty line; rejects
  early/duplicate/trailing/unknown); --parse-result and --classify test
  modes; --smoke isolated one-turn no-op CLI check; --smoke-perms isolated
  sentinel-file permission smoke (mechanical: token surfacing + checksum,
  not self-report); --tools restricted to Read,Edit,Write,Grep,Glob,Bash;
  --strict-mcp-config with mcp__*denied and --setting-sources project (no
  MCP/connector, no user/local widening); Read/Edit path-scoped to project;
  explicit secret-path denials (.env*, *.env, credentials,*.pem, *.key,
  ~/ , //etc) plus merge/deploy/destructive/DB/network denials and direct
  git-push denial; --permission-mode default; NEVER
  --dangerously-skip-permissions; git-fetch failure exits documented code 6.
- scripts/rico-supervisor-push.sh + scripts/supervisor_push_gate.py — NEW
  deterministic push gate (owner review round 2): the ONLY sanctioned push
  path for supervised sessions. Round 3: raw gh pr create is denied (it can
  implicitly push an unpushed branch — an alternate push path); the gate's
  --create-pr mode first proves origin/<branch> exists AND equals local
  HEAD, then runs gh pr create --draft --head <branch> --base main (no push
  side effect; refusals create nothing and push nothing). Round 4: push and
  PR creation share ONE read-only validation (validate_against_live_state)
  run immediately before either action — no TOCTOU window between passing
  the push gate and creating the PR; passthrough accepts content flags only
  (reserved identity/state flags --head/-H --base/-B --draft --repo/-R
  --web --dry-run are rejected before gh is ever invoked). Immediately before pushing it re-fetches
  origin/main and mechanically checks merge-base freshness, changed-file
  overlap vs main and every open PR, and Task-ID uniqueness (frozen
  TASK-20260721-005 exception pinned to its two EXACT historical headings,
  not a count); refuses with nothing pushed (exit 2) on conflict; exit 6 on
  preconditions (non-claude/ branch, dirty tree, missing gh, fetch failure).
- tests/test_development_supervisor_contract.py — 52 static + functional
  guards: Task-ID uniqueness incl. exact-heading pin and swapped-duplicate
  rejection, strict-parser subprocess matrix, scoping/denial checks
  (Read(//etc/**) double-slash absolute form), --tools availability
  restriction, MCP isolation (--strict-mcp-config + mcp__* deny +
  --setting-sources project), push-only-via-gate, permission-smoke presence,
  launcher fetch-failure exit 6 (functional), and fail-before push-gate
  matrix in temp repos with a fake gh (non-claude branch / main advanced
  with overlapping file / newly opened overlapping PR / duplicate Task ID —
  each refuses without pushing; clean case pushes; --check-only never
  pushes). Round 3 adds: create-pr refusal matrix (unpushed branch and
  head-mismatch refuse with gh never invoked and remote untouched; clean
  case creates the PR with explicit --head and zero push side effect,
  proven by ls-remote before/after), gh-pr-create denial guards, and a
  behavioral IDLE test (fake Claude returns IDLE; every file, ref, and
  status byte under the working tree identical before/after; run log lands
  outside the repository — XDG state dir default, project-local default
  forbidden by guard). Round 4 adds: shared-validation static pin (both
  paths call validate_against_live_state; reserved-flag list pinned) and
  TOCTOU fail-before tests (main drift after push but before create -> no
  PR; competing PR after push -> no PR; reserved override flags -> rejected
  with gh never invoked; clean case unchanged).

#### Explicitly out of scope (owner directive)

- PR #1304 content and its follow-up cancellation implementation — untouched
  (its merge into base 0e0497ba is inherited, not modified).
- LOW-1, LOW-2, Constitutional AI, any product feature — not started.

- Current head SHA: final head = the ledger-finalization commit recorded in
  DEVELOPMENT_LOOP_STATE.md (two-commit pattern; its validated_head_sha is
  the work commit the full evidence ran against; exact SHAs in the ledger

- Status: in_review — Draft PR #1305; merge is owner-gated
- Validation already run: focused contract suite 52/52 at the work commit;

  (safe read surfaced token, denied .env-style read leaked nothing, denied
  edit left checksum unchanged)
- Validation still required: none beyond the automatic full CI on the final
  head (must be green before the merge decision; verified in PR #1305 checks)
- Deployment: none — docs/skill/script/test only; no runtime path imports
  any of these files
- Known blockers: none
- Risks: permission lists are defense in depth, not a sandbox (Grep/Glob
  remain an absolute-path read surface — documented); prose-rule compliance
  is pinned statically, not proven at runtime
- Rollback plan: revert the PR (pure additive files; nothing references them)
- Next exact action: owner review / merge decision on PR #1305 (all review
  rounds remediated; nothing further scheduled by the session)
- Stop condition: STOP at Draft PR + evidence report; owner reviews before

data_frames=1 done_json=True frame_types=done`; synthetic user and all rows
removed. RESULT: 15 passed, 0 failed — SMOKE: ALL GREEN.

Root cause of the prior SSE "Unauthorized": smoke-tool cookie transport
(production sets `Domain=.ricohunt.com`; direct onrender client did not replay
it) — fixed in #1287 via explicit Set-Cookie capture/replay (the #1264
pattern). Product SSE path confirmed healthy at this baseline.

#### Scope correction (what this run does NOT prove)

- `main` moved after the run: #1304 (operation ownership / partial multi-worker
  hardening — touches operation_state, chat_operations claim,
  rico_chat_api) and #1305 (development-supervisor control layer) merged;
  head at record time 0939e28. The 15/15 result is NOT evidence for these
  later commits.
- It does NOT close TASK-20260721-014 / stabilization slice 4: #1306
  (end-to-end cooperative cancellation, Draft, head 39a8fd82) is outside
  `main`; the post-claim-partition duplicate-cascade window remains open.
- It does NOT authorize raising Render workers/instances (gate stays CLOSED,
  workers/instances = 1).
- The smoke TOOL itself needs no rebuild — it is now evidence-grade
  (frame-type dump + isolation probes + explicit cookie replay).

#### Re-verification conditions (owner-specified; run after #1306 merges AND deploys)

```text
1. /version يطابق آخر backend deploy commit
2. workers/instances تبقى 1
3. RICO_OPERATION_STORE verified as intended
4. Delivery-Smoke 15/15
5. عملية بحث حقيقية تنتهي وتصل للمستخدم
6. لا duplicate cascade
7. لا stale-owner terminal write
8. synthetic data cleanup complete
```

#### Continuity Block

- Current head SHA: (this docs commit)
- Status: done — record only; AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md is the sole file changed
- Validation already run: run 29818358371 log quoted from GitHub Actions;
  main head, #1304/#1305 merge state, and #1306 Draft head verified live
- Validation still required: the 8-condition re-verification above, only
  after #1306 is merged and deployed
- Deployment: none
- Known blockers: none for the record; slice-4 blocker unchanged
  (post-claim-partition cascade cancellation = #1306)
- Risks: none (docs)
- Rollback plan: revert the docs commit
- Next exact action: owner decision on #1306; after its merge + deploy,
  re-run Delivery-Smoke under the 8 conditions with workers = 1
- Stop condition: STOP after this record merges; no re-run scheduled by agent

### TASK-20260722-001 — P1 CV-generation integrity: trace + bounded vertical slice plan

Status: review (RFC gate — owner review of 2026-07-22 applied in rev 2; merge
and implementation NOT yet authorized)
Owner: Claude (session claude/cv-generation-integrity-cgggby)
Branch: claude/cv-generation-integrity-cgggby
Issue/PR: #1312 (docs-only RFC — stays docs-only; implementation will be a
FRESH Draft PR from then-current main under this same TASK ID after the RFC
merges)

#### Objective

Record the read-only repository trace of the P1 tailored-CV incident and the
owner-approved implementation boundary for ONE deterministic vertical slice:
selected readable CV → provenance-bearing fact sheet → deterministic
Operations/Dubai CV → verified DOCX persisted with retention controls →
JWT-scoped download → Arabic redacted-transcript regression.

#### Owner decisions (2026-07-22, PR #1312 review + re-review — ALL ANSWERED)

- DOCX v1: persist bytes; unbounded storage NOT approved. Approved bounds:
  2 MiB hard DOCX cap, SHA-256 write/read-back, account-deletion cleanup,
  strict user scope, sanitized download filename; creation consumes the
  existing profile_optimization_limit allowance; absolute 60 retained
  artifacts per user (creation purges oldest beyond cap).
- Retention: 90 days from creation as logical expiry + lazy physical purge
  (persisted expires_at; expired rows 404 on read; bounded-batch deletes on
  create/download; account deletion immediate). No scheduler in v1.
- Extracted text: 512 KiB hard cap; truncation REJECTED — over-cap = honest
  4xx, no row, no mutation. `failed` status reserved for existing rows that
  later fail re-validation/reparse; failed NEW uploads create no row.
- My Files parsing: in-slice, doc_type=cv only; parse-or-honest-failure —
  never a new metadata-only CV row; explicit extraction_status
  (ready/legacy_missing/failed) + parser version.
- Transcript: never commit verbatim (public repo, real personal data). The
  redaction CONTRACT is approved; the actual synthetic fixture (exact token
  mapping) is reviewed in the implementation PR — not a blocker on the RFC.
- First slice is deterministic — no free-form AI rewrite; AI rephrasing is a
  later, separately gated enhancement.
- career_context reuse limited to identity/name/years trust; document fact
  extraction is a new bounded component with offset-based provenance
  {document_id, start_offset, end_offset, source_hash}.
- No migration number reserved by the RFC — implementation uses the next
  available number at its then-current main.
- Process: #1312 stays docs-only; no scheduled polling (webhook-only PR
  monitoring; the armed 1-hour check-in was cancelled).

#### Context

- Evidence + full plan: AI_WORKSPACE/proposals/2026-07-22-cv-generation-integrity-slice.md
- Relevant files (traced, unmodified):
  src/rico_chat_api.py (:452 dead placeholder guard, :6121 pending-city resume,
  :8045 cv_builder follow-up gate, :9954 cv_generate routing, :11779 generic AI
  fallback, :15113 _handle_cv_generate_from_profile, :2795 active-CV-only copy),
  src/agent/intelligence/intent_classifier.py (:644 _CV_GENERATE_RE),
  src/rico_apply_ai.py (:66 "[Your Name]" placeholder, :71 tailor_application),
  src/api/routers/apply_queue.py, src/api/routers/files.py (metadata-only
  upload :174, set-primary partial resync :355),
  src/rico_db.py (:201 user_documents DDL — no text column),
  src/api/routers/rico_chat.py (:2500 confirm persists no doc text, :2540
  profile cv_text single slot), migrations/032, migrations/038,
  src/services/career_context.py, src/services/document_resolver.py,
  apps/web/lib/translations.ts (:604 My Files promise).
- Existing behavior: non-active CV documents retain only metadata; CV draft
  handler renders profile-scalar skeleton and never reads cv_text; Arabic
  role/city tailoring follow-ups fall to generic AI fallback; tailoring engine
  is prompt-only ("never invent") with no reconciliation; no generated-document
  artifact or download endpoint exists.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: production deploys, provider routing, agent_runtime action
  scheme, safety-layer bypasses, Cognitive Control Plane scope, career-context
  M2 identity dedupe.
- Migrations: additive only (user_documents.extracted_text + generated_documents
  table), 026/038 precedent, drift-checked.
- Keep scope limited to: the single slice in the proposal; one PR.

#### Acceptance criteria — RFC gate (#1312; can close before implementation)

- [x] Design reviewed (read-only trace with file:line evidence +
      deterministic-first slice per the approved boundary)
- [x] Owner decisions recorded as answered (bounds approved with fail-closed
      semantics: 512 KiB extracted-text/no truncation; 2 MiB DOCX; 90-day
      logical expiry + lazy purge on create AND download; 60-artifact cap;
      allowance consumption)
- [x] Exact-head CI green (verified by owner at 6e1da2b; re-run on each
      corrective head)
- [ ] Owner RFC merge decision on #1312

Implementation is a SEPARATE second gate (fresh Draft PR, same TASK ID) — see
the implementation criteria below; nothing in the RFC gate starts it.

#### Acceptance criteria — implementation gate (fresh Draft PR, same TASK ID)

- [ ] Steps 1–6 implemented per merged RFC
- [ ] Redacted production-structure fixture reviewed and approved in the
      implementation PR (token mapping; private transcript stays out of git)
- [ ] All invariants green in the regression suite; existing CV suites green;
      frontend build green
- [ ] No deploy / no production migration without separate owner authorization

#### Required verification

- [ ] Unit tests: n/a for this docs-only PR
- [ ] Integration tests: n/a
- [ ] Frontend build: n/a
- [ ] Local smoke: n/a

### TASK-20260723-001 — Clarification / Needs-Input transcript treatment (Command chat)

Status: implemented / verification in progress
Owner: Claude (agent) / owner review
Branch: fix/command-clarification-needs-input
Issue/PR: #1326 (Draft)

#### Objective

Give `type: "clarification"` responses (Rico needs one detail or decision
from the user before continuing) their own visually and semantically
distinct transcript treatment — calm, editorial, Atelier, clearly distinct
from both a normal reply and a failure — using only the existing, already
production-shipped `type: "clarification"` field. No backend changes.
Superseded priority (owner decision, 2026-07-23): the previously proposed
progress-row/CHECK-RUN presentation slice is paused, unimplemented — no code
was written for it; nothing to preserve or roll back.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `apps/web/components/command/CommandEventAdapter.ts`;
  `apps/web/components/command/CommandTranscriptStep.tsx`;
  `apps/web/lib/translations.ts`;
  `apps/web/__tests__/command-transcript-step.test.tsx`
- Relevant docs: this session's Visible Work response-style read-only audit
  (owner-accepted 2026-07-23); `CommandEventAdapter.ts`'s anti-fabrication
  contract (no PLAN/TOOL events invented; CHECK/FAIL rows only from real
  `agentic_ui.progress`)
- Existing behavior: `src/rico_chat_api.py` already returns
  `{"type": "clarification", ...}` from 30+ real call sites (sign-in-required,
  missing job context, ambiguous role, etc. — e.g. lines 12868, 12918, 13436),
  each carrying `message` and often `options`/`next_action`. Both transport
  paths (`/chat` JSON via `RicoChatResponseSchema`'s `extra="allow"`,
  `/chat/stream` SSE via raw `_sse_done` `json.dumps`) already deliver `type`
  untouched to the frontend — confirmed during the PR #1325 persistence-
  contract hotfix trace. `CommandEventAdapter.classifyMessage()` does not
  check for `type === "clarification"`, so these messages fall through to
  the generic `"rico"` row kind today — rendered as ordinary prose,
  indistinguishable from a normal reply.

**History-restore defect found by the required browser smoke (2026-07-23),
fixed in this task:** the live-send path worked correctly (confirmed by
browser smoke against PR #1326's preview), but `apps/web/app/command/page.tsx`'s
`parseHistoryContent()` generic structured-response fallback (the branch
reached by any `type` not explicitly special-cased as `job_matches`/
`options`/`help`/`application_status`) returned `{ id, role: "rico", text,
options }` with no `type` field at all. A `type: "clarification"` message
therefore classified correctly when freshly streamed, but silently
downgraded to plain `"rico"` prose the moment it was reloaded from history
or reached via a Sessions-rail switch — losing the exact "paused, not
failed" signal this task exists to preserve, on the one path (history
restore) every real user hits on every page load. Fix: the fallback now
also returns `type: parsed.type as string | undefined`. `next_action` was
NOT added — verified first (per owner instruction) that no current
component reads the singular `next_action` field anywhere, and no sibling
branch in `parseHistoryContent` sets it either, so adding it would be a
speculative, currently-unused field. As a byproduct, `profile_preview`/
`profile_gap`/`role_confirmation` (also in `CARD_TYPES` but not explicitly
branched in `parseHistoryContent`) now also correctly restore as `"card"`
from history instead of the same latent bug — not a new contract, the same
one-line fix applied generically as specified.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: backend/API code; the `type` value itself; add no new
  backend fields; `JobMatchCardAtelier`, `PermissionRequestCard`,
  `ProposedChangeCard`, `ChatActionCard` (duplication reported in the audit,
  not refactored here); `operationState.ts`'s `pickOperationState()`
  (provisional-state visual distinction is a proposal only in the audit
  report, not implemented in this task unless owner narrows it to a very
  small isolated change).
- No migrations.
- Keep scope limited to: one new `TranscriptRowKind` (`"needs_input"`), its
  presentation in `CommandTranscriptStep`, new translation keys, and tests.
- Scope expanded by owner (2026-07-23) by exactly one runtime file:
  `apps/web/app/command/page.tsx` — limited to preserving `type` (and
  verifying, not adding, `next_action`) in `parseHistoryContent()`'s generic
  fallback. No other change to `page.tsx`.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] `classifyMessage()` returns `"needs_input"` if and only if
      `message.type === "clarification"` — never inferred from reply text
- [x] New row: distinct gutter/label (`ask`/`سؤال`), calm/editorial Atelier
      styling, visually distinct from `"rico"` (normal) and `"fail"` rows;
      no warning-red treatment; sun-red used only as a sparing accent (small
      dot + label color)
- [x] `role="status" aria-live="polite"` on the new row (never assertive)
- [x] Full Rico reply text preserved verbatim; existing options/next_action
      chips render unchanged (children pass-through untouched) — verified
      both via unit test and live/history browser smoke
- [x] No duplicated question text (the label is a state indicator, not a
      paraphrase of the message)
- [x] Reduced-motion respected, mobile-safe (verified via browser smoke at
      390×844), no layout jump
- [x] Hydrated history rows (`skipEntranceAnimation`) do not re-animate or
      re-announce — verified via the real `parseHistoryContent` pipeline
      (initial load AND Sessions-rail switch), not just the isolated
      component
- [x] Composer keyboard focus behavior unchanged (already unconditional via
      the existing `textareaRef.current?.focus()` in `sendMessage`'s
      `finally` block — no new code needed for this)
- [x] EN/AR labels natural, correct RTL — verified via browser smoke,
      `document.documentElement.dir="rtl"`/`lang="ar"`, labels render in
      natural logical order (not manually reversed)
- [x] Full suite green; tsc/eslint/build clean
- [x] History-restore fix: a `type: "clarification"` message reloaded from
      history, or reached via a Sessions-rail session switch, classifies as
      `"needs_input"` exactly like a live message — not just on first send

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: `command-transcript-step.test.tsx` (19 cases: classification,
      presentation, aria, children/options preserved, history-replay) +
      `command-clarification-history-restore.test.tsx` (6 new cases: real
      history-parsing pipeline classification, normal/job_matches/options/
      application_status branches unaffected, Sessions-rail switch restore
      with entrance-animation suppression)
- [x] Integration tests: n/a — no backend contract change
- [x] Frontend build: `npm run build` — clean
- [x] Local smoke (first pass, live path only): browser smoke against PR
      #1326's initial preview — EN, AR RTL, mobile width, live send, no fail
      styling, all confirmed
- [ ] Local smoke (second pass, history-restore fix): re-run against the
      updated preview once deployed — reload + Sessions-rail switch restore,
      EN/AR/mobile, no replayed entrance animation. NOT YET RUN as of this
      commit — pending, to be done before marking Ready for Review
- [ ] Production/deploy smoke if applicable: n/a — no merge/deploy this PR

### TASK-20260723-002 — Medium Workspace Layout (/command 900–1199px and 768–899px tiers)

Status: implemented / browser smoke pending
Owner: Claude (agent) / owner review
Branch: feat/command-medium-workspace-layout
Issue/PR: #1329 (Draft)

#### Objective

Preserve `/command`'s "Career Workspace" identity — not an anonymous chat —
at medium desktop/tablet widths, per the owner-corrected breakpoint contract:

- **≥1200px**: full sessions rail (232px), full transcript, full
  career-context rail (272px) — rebalanced from the prior 260px/300px so the
  transcript keeps priority width.
- **900–1199px**: compact sessions rail (80px, icon/initial-based, NOT
  anonymous dots), transcript stays primary, career context opens via a
  "Career context" drawer (not inline).
- **768–899px**: transcript full width; Sessions and Career-context each open
  via their own drawer; persistent workspace trigger buttons stay visible so
  the surface still reads as a workspace, not a bare chat.
- **<768px**: unchanged — no regression to composer/cards/RTL/scrolling/
  keyboard.
Frontend-only. No backend, no data model, no new job-card/permission-card
redesign.

#### Context

- Relevant files: `apps/web/components/command/CommandObsidianShell.tsx`;
  `apps/web/components/command/CommandConversationRail.tsx`;
  `apps/web/components/command/CommandRail.tsx`;
  `apps/web/components/command/CommandWorkspaceDrawer.tsx` (new);
  `apps/web/app/command/page.tsx`; `apps/web/lib/translations.ts`
- Tailwind v3 confirmed (`apps/web/package.json`), no custom `screens` in
  `tailwind.config.ts` — used arbitrary-value breakpoint variants
  (`min-[1200px]:`, `min-[900px]:`) rather than editing the global config, to
  keep the change contained to files in scope.
- Owner-mandated design constraint: CSS/Tailwind-only responsive rendering —
  no `window.matchMedia`/resize-listener "layout tier" JS state machine (avoids
  hydration flicker). All rail/drawer variants render simultaneously in the
  DOM; Tailwind breakpoint classes decide which is visually shown. React state
  is used only for drawer open/closed (`sessionsDrawerOpen`,
  `careerDrawerOpen` in `page.tsx`).
- Known jsdom implication of the CSS-only pattern: jsdom does not evaluate
  real CSS media queries, so both the full and compact rail instances are
  simultaneously present and query-able in tests. Existing tests that did
  unscoped `getByRole`/`getByText` queries against Sessions-rail buttons were
  updated to scope with `within(screen.getByTestId("command-obsidian-leftrail"))`
  — not a behavior regression, a test-authoring consequence of the required
  architecture.
- Verified (owner mid-task spot-check): `CommandConversationRail.tsx`'s full
  variant has exactly one root wrapper (`w-[232px]`, was `w-[260px]`) — no
  duplicate 260px wrapper left behind. The compact variant is a distinct,
  separately-tagged early-return branch (`data-testid=
  "command-conversation-rail-compact"`, `w-20`), not a shrunk copy of the
  full-text rail.
- `MobileCommandHeader.tsx` (<768px mobile nav/drawer) is untouched — a new,
  dedicated, content-agnostic `CommandWorkspaceDrawer` primitive was built
  instead of extending or duplicating the mobile drawer, to avoid
  destabilizing mobile nav.

#### Constraints

- Do not touch: job-card redesign, permission-card redesign, Arabic font
  changes, STOP gutter, backend progress events, new data models, fake
  counts/jobs/progress, sound effects, unrelated cleanup.
- Do not alter current mobile (<768px) navigation behavior — `768px belongs
  to the drawer tier, not the mobile tier` (owner correction).
- No JS viewport-width state machine; React state manages only drawer
  open/closed.
- No anonymous session dots in the compact rail — real derived initial,
  active-state marker, native tooltip, full accessible name required.
- Do not directly shrink the existing 260px rail as the "compact" tier — a
  genuinely different compact branch was required and built.
- RTL: logical properties only (`start-0`/`end-0`, `border-inline-start`),
  no hardcoded left/right; Sessions drawer opens from inline-start, Career
  context drawer opens from inline-end.

#### Acceptance criteria

- [x] ≥1200px: full three-column layout renders (232px sessions rail /
      transcript / 272px career-context rail)
- [x] 900–1199px: compact icon/initial sessions rail renders; career context
      is drawer-only (not inline)
- [x] 768–899px: transcript full width; Sessions and Career-context both
      drawer-only; persistent trigger buttons visible in the topbar
- [x] <768px: unchanged (no new code path touches `MobileCommandHeader.tsx`)
- [x] `CommandWorkspaceDrawer`: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`,
      `aria-labelledby`, focus enters panel on open, Escape/backdrop/
      close-button close it, focus returns to the trigger on close,
      `motion-reduce:animate-none` respected (reuses the existing
      `animate-fade-in-scale` utility already used by the account menu)
- [x] Trigger buttons: `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` matching the drawer's
      real DOM `id`
- [x] Compact rail: real derived initial (not a dot), `aria-label` with full
      session title, native `title` tooltip, active-state marker
- [x] RTL: drawer `side="start"`/`side="end"` resolve to `start-0`/`end-0` in
      both languages (logical properties, no isRTL branching for position)
- [x] TypeScript: baseline failure, zero new errors — `tsc --noEmit` output
      is byte-identical (48 errors, same files/lines/codes) between this
      branch and base SHA, verified via isolated worktree, not just a grep —
      see Required verification
- [x] ESLint clean on all changed/new files (pre-existing unrelated
      `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` + React Compiler findings in
      `page.tsx` confirmed present at the same lines, shifted only by line
      offset, on the unmodified base branch — not introduced by this change)
- [x] Full test suite green (917/917, incl. 20 new dedicated tests)
- [ ] Full required browser-smoke matrix (10 widths × EN/AR RTL) executed
      against a deployed preview — pending

#### Required verification

- [x] Unit tests: 3 existing test files updated for the intentional
      width/breakpoint class-string changes
      (`command-obsidian-noregression.test.tsx`,
      `command-obsidian-shell.test.tsx`) and the compact-rail-caused query
      ambiguity (`command-clarification-history-restore.test.tsx`); one new
      dedicated file, `command-medium-workspace-layout.test.tsx` (20 cases:

- [x] `npx vitest run` (full suite): 917/917 passing
- [x] TypeScript: baseline failure, zero new errors. `npx tsc --noEmit` on
      this branch: 48 errors. Identical command run against an isolated
      `git worktree` checked out at base SHA
      `8c1c5dc1a168f00e5eba02887c520b48a4c107c0` (node_modules copied in, no
      dependency changes on this branch to invalidate that): also 48 errors.
      `diff` of the two full outputs (paths, line:col, error codes, messages)
      is empty — byte-for-byte identical. All 48 are in files this branch
      does not touch (`send-double-tap-guard.test.ts`,
      `sidebar-nav-routing.test.ts`, `subscription-atelier.test.tsx`,
      `internal-preview-protection.test.tsx`, `paddle-event-callback.test.ts`,
      `scheduled-search-card.test.tsx`). Not described as "TypeScript
      passing" — it is a pre-existing baseline failure this branch does not
      add to.

- Current head SHA: 371a98186d950af07dc2739133b2d68b16f4ac33
- Uncommitted changes present: no (after this commit)
- Status: implemented / browser smoke pending
- Files inspected: all files listed in Context above, plus
  `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts` (confirmed no
  custom `screens`), `apps/web/components/command/MobileCommandHeader.tsx`
  (confirmed untouched)
- Files changed: `AI_WORKSPACE/TASKS.md`;
  `apps/web/components/command/CommandObsidianShell.tsx`;
  `apps/web/components/command/CommandConversationRail.tsx`;
  `apps/web/components/command/CommandRail.tsx`;

  `apps/web/__tests__/command-clarification-history-restore.test.tsx`;
  `apps/web/__tests__/command-medium-workspace-layout.test.tsx` (new)
- Files intentionally not touched: `apps/web/components/command/
  MobileCommandHeader.tsx`; `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`; job-card/
  permission-card components; backend (`src/**`)
- What is complete: implementation of all four tiers, new
  `CommandWorkspaceDrawer` primitive, compact-rail accessible identity,
  `CommandRail` bare variant reused for the career-context drawer, full
  test suite green, tsc/eslint baseline-compared (zero new errors/findings)
  against base SHA, production build clean, committed, pushed, Draft PR
  #1329 opened
- What is incomplete: full browser-smoke matrix against the deployed
  Vercel preview
- Known blockers: none
- Risks: presentational/layout-only change; no backend or data contract
  touched; the CSS-only "render all variants, gate with Tailwind" pattern
  means jsdom tests must scope queries — documented above and already
  applied to the pre-existing tests that needed it
- Rollback plan: revert commit 371a98186d950af07dc2739133b2d68b16f4ac33 on
  this branch (or close PR #1329 without merging); `MobileCommandHeader.tsx`
  and all backend/data paths are untouched, so rollback is a pure frontend
  revert with no data or contract unwind
- Next exact action: run the required browser-smoke matrix against PR
  #1329's Vercel preview once it deploys, then report results
- Stop condition: do not merge or deploy production

### TASK-20260723-003 — Rico Chat Visual Alignment

Status: verified locally / rebased on main 9ca0d44d / smoke complete / Draft PR #1331 ready for push
Owner: Windsurf WRITER / owner review
Branch: design/rico-chat-composer
Issue/PR: #1331 (Draft)

#### Objective

Align the existing `/command` chat presentation with the owner-provided
`rico-chat-design.html` reference while preserving current behavior,
responsive tiers, safety controls, audience isolation, and PR #1329's merged
medium-workspace architecture.

#### Scope and acceptance

- Frontend presentation only; no backend, auth, billing, database, migration,
  provider, routing, landing-page, deployment, or production mutation work.
- Base: `main` at `9ca0d44d` (rebased from `608451ea`).
- Owner explicitly approved processing this task on 2026-07-23.
- Atelier semantic tokens only; no parallel design system or user-specific logic.
- Preserve behavior, approval/safety actions, English, and Arabic/RTL paths.
- Rebase, focused tests, production build, scoped diff, and Draft PR required.
- Responsive browser smoke is mandatory before Ready-for-Review or merge.

#### Continuity Block

- Task ID: TASK-20260723-003
- Objective: owner-approved visual alignment of the existing Rico chat UI to
  `rico-chat-design.html`, with no behavior or backend changes
- Authority role: WRITER
- Activity pass: Coder, then Tester
- Owner/session: Windsurf / owner review
- Branch: `design/rico-chat-composer`
- Base: `main` @ `9ca0d44d` (rebased from `608451ea`)
- Head before ledger update: rebased on `9ca0d44d` + test fix pending commit
- Rollback branch: `backup/rico-chat-composer-pre-rebase-20260723`
- PR: #1331 (Draft)
- Files changed: `CommandComposer.tsx`, `WorkspaceShell.tsx`,
  `command-obsidian-shell.test.tsx` (rail width 220px assertion fix), plus
  this task ledger
- Post-rebase verification: focused Vitest 334/334 passed; `npm run build`
  passed with 48/48 routes; `git diff --check` passed
- Responsive browser smoke: 28 Playwright captures completed — desktop
  (1440px), tablet (900px), mobile (390px) × EN/AR × light/dark ×
  empty/active transcript; no horizontal overflow detected on any
  viewport
- Status: implementation rebased on `9ca0d44d`, verified, smoke complete;
  ready for force-push and CI
- Risks: broad visual diff overlaps PR #1329 surfaces; smoke passed
  without issues
- Product scope: all `/command` users; global, user-agnostic, synthetic test
  fixtures only, no owner-account special-casing
- Must not touch: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, backend `src/**`, migrations,
  auth/session/JWT/cookies, billing, deploy configuration, or unrelated
  untracked screenshots/design assets
- Uncommitted tracked changes: `command-obsidian-shell.test.tsx` (rail
  width assertion fix); unrelated pre-existing untracked assets remain
  untouched
- Deploy/CI/Neon/Vercel: no deploy or Neon action; CI/Vercel pending after
  force-push
- Rollback: close the Draft PR or revert the task commits; no data/schema/API
  unwind required
- Next action: force-push rebased branch, update PR #1331 description, wait
  for CI, then mark Ready for Review
- Stop condition: do not merge or deploy; stop on test/build failure,
  unexpected file overlap, or behavior change
