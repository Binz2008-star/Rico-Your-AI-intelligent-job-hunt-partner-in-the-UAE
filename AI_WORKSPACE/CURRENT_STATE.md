# Current State

_Last updated: 2026-06-22 (job-flow stabilization complete through PR #730; only PR C remains)_

## Production baseline

- **Repository main HEAD / production backend SHA:** `38fbf5da19975df6f7d3d21168b137741d502e6d` (#730 PR D role-parsing edge cases).
- **Production deploy verification:** `/version` matched `38fbf5da19975df6f7d3d21168b137741d502e6d`; `/health` returned 200; `Deploy Render Backend` and `Deploy to Production` workflows completed successfully for the merge SHA.
- **Vercel:** production/root/proxy healthy by deploy verification report.
- **Render logs:** direct Render MCP log scan was unavailable/unauthorized in the session; no error signals were observed from health checks or deploy workflows.

## Job-flow stabilization — 2026-06-22 complete

Rico's job-search flow was stabilized through a focused merge train. Each PR stayed in one bug category, used mocked tests/fixtures, avoided provider quota burn, and excluded #712 DB migration work, billing changes, landing-page changes, and provider scraping.

| PR | Category | Merge SHA | Deploy | Tests / notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| **#727** | P0 — job-card apply-link integrity + canonical `src/services/job_link.py` | `e1d87fc` | ✅ verified | `test_job_card_apply_link_integrity.py`; no more missing required `link` error |
| **#724** | P1 — low-cost provider cascade (cache → internal → Jooble → Adzuna → JSearch → degraded CTA) | `5fe9171` | ✅ verified | `test_job_providers.py`, `test_provider_degraded_ux.py` |
| **#723** | P1 — multi-role parsing (`extract_role_list`, `job_search_multi_role`) | `713ea75` | ✅ verified | `test_multi_role_search_*.py` |
| **#728** | P0 follow-up — route ordinal apply-link requests past job-detail gate | `c77781a` | ✅ verified | `test_ordinal_apply_link_routing.py` |
| **#729** | PR B — save the Nth job to pipeline from recent search context | `963e40b` | ✅ verified | `test_save_ordinal_to_pipeline.py` |
| **#730** | PR D — role parsing edge cases: `only`, jobs-for-A-and-B, CV exclusions, category mapping / not coding | `38fbf5d` | ✅ verified | `test_role_parsing_edge_cases.py` |

## Key production behaviors now live

- `src/services/job_link.py` is the **only canonical apply-link resolver**. Do not reintroduce `src/rico_link_resolver.py`.
- Job cards and chat apply-link commands share canonical `usable_link` / `link_unavailable` fields.
- `apply_job` no longer throws `Job payload is missing required 'link' field`; missing trusted links produce safe fallback CTAs.
- Ordinal apply-link commands work for first/second/last job references from recent search context.
- Save-to-pipeline works for ordinal references such as "save the second job".
- Provider cascade is live: cache(24h) → internal → Jooble → Adzuna → JSearch → degraded fallback CTA.
- `/health` exposes `job_providers` configured/degraded state only; no secret values.
- Role parsing now handles:
  - `Technical Product Owner only` → `Technical Product Owner`
  - `jobs for HSE Manager and QHSE Manager` → both roles
  - CV-based search with `do not search …` exclusions
  - `product and technical management jobs, not coding jobs` → allowed management roles + coding exclusions

## Provider env

Set in Render by the owner; presence only is observable via `/health`:

- `JOOBLE_API_KEY`
- `ADZUNA_APP_ID` + `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` (Adzuna opt-in; both required)
- `RAPIDAPI_KEY` (JSearch)

No provider keys are hardcoded, committed, or logged.

## Production Tests 1–9 status

| Test | Bug | Status |
|---|---|---|
| T2 | `Technical Product Owner only` qualifier | ✅ fixed live (#730) |
| T3 | `HSE Manager and QHSE Manager` jobs-for-A-and-B order | ✅ fixed live (#730) |
| T4 | 3-role comma list as one role | ✅ fixed live (#723) |
| T5 | CV-based search + `do not search …` exclusions | ✅ fixed live (#730) |
| T6 | category mapping `product/technical management` + `not coding` | ✅ fixed live (#730) |
| T8 | `save the second job to pipeline` not wired to recent context | ✅ fixed live (#729) |
| T9 | open apply link → missing-link error | ✅ fixed live (#727 + #728) |
| T1 | strongest CV profile ignored; stale `target_role` | 🔴 open → **PR C** |
| T7 | silent role substitution + auth/CV context loss + weak location | 🔴 open → **PR C** |

## Remaining next PR

### PR C — profile/context role selection (not started yet)

Branch recommendation: `fix/profile-context-role-selection`

Scope:

- T1: `Find UAE jobs that match my strongest CV profile.`
  - Do not blindly use stale `target_role` such as Software Engineer.
  - Use the strongest confirmed active CV/profile signal.
  - Ask the user to choose if multiple profile tracks are ambiguous.

- T7: `Search UAE jobs for Environmental Manager.`
  - Do not silently substitute Environmental Manager with Environmental Officer.
  - Ask permission before broadening if exact role is unavailable.
  - Preserve authenticated user/CV/session context.
  - Do not ask a logged-in Pro user with uploaded CV to sign up or upload again.
  - Keep location UAE-focused with safe preference for UAE/Ajman/Dubai/Sharjah/Abu Dhabi.

Hard guardrails:

- No auth rewrite.
- No billing changes.
- No DB migration.
- No #712 work.
- No landing-page work.
- No provider scraping.
- No repeated real provider searches.
- Use mocks/fixtures only in tests.
- Keep `src/services/job_link.py` as the only canonical resolver.
- Do not reintroduce `src/rico_link_resolver.py`.

## Superseded / duplicate PRs

- **#726** — closed as superseded by #727 + #728 + #729. Do not rebase or salvage it.
- **#722** — degraded job-card fallback CTAs; overlaps #724/#727. Close or rebase only if a new focused gap is proven.

## Important older context still relevant

- **#712 DB migration drift:** still separate; do not mix with job-flow work.
- **System Quality Audit PR #717:** draft/CI-green status was documented earlier; do not merge without separate review.
- **Migration `030_action_audit_log_hardening.sql`:** applied + verified in production Neon on 2026-06-21.
- **Migration `021_user_job_context_alt_url.sql`:** applied; issue #710 closed.
- **Issue #711 drift:** `005 pipeline_runs` and `011 idx_rico_recommendations_user_job_unique` remain not applied unless separately approved.
- **Canonical handoff:** `AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-06-22-job-flow-stabilization-complete.md`.

## Recommended next command

```text
Rico mode. Start PR C only from clean current origin/main. First do read-only mapping of current CV/profile selection, target_role loading, auth/CV context loss, and role substitution. Report the smallest safe implementation plan before large edits. Branch: fix/profile-context-role-selection.
```
