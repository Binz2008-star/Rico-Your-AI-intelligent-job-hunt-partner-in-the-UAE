## CI health

- Render deploy: `workflow_dispatch` only. Must be triggered manually after each release.

## PR #638 status (2026-06-19)

- Draft PR open on `engineering/system-overhaul-v2`.
- Vercel preview: ✅ deployed.
- pytest: queued at last check.
- playwright: in_progress at last check.

## Next product roadmap order

Do not start without explicit scope and branch assignment.

1. **PR #638** — merge system overhaul v1+v2 once CI green.
2. **#355 Follow-up Reminders** — Phase 1 merged (`a95c413`); owner must apply
   migration + set `RICO_CRON_SECRET` + wire Render Cron.
3. **#356 Inbox Intelligence** (design-only; connector design doc on `main`).

## Carry-over engineering backlog

- JWT revocation after password reset (old sessions stay valid after reset)
- Per-user rate limiting on /apply endpoint
- Race condition in guest→auth identity merge
- Settings page keywords tag input (same UX fix as profile TagInputField)
- Password complexity validation on register/reset

## Operating target

Use one repeatable workflow:

1. Scope one task.
2. Write or update the task in `TASKS.md`.
3. Generate one handoff brief.
4. Assign exactly one writer for the branch.
5. Require implementation notes and verification evidence.
6. Record final decisions and remaining risks.

## Quality gates

Use the applicable gates for each task:

- backend tests
- frontend build
- local smoke checks
- deployment verification when applicable
- no secrets changed
- no unrelated files changed
- rollback plan included
