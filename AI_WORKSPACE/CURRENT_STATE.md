## System Quality Audit — 2026-06-21 (PR #717, branch `claude/system-quality-audit-ikkamf`)

Full codebase audit covering auth, DB, repositories, services, migrations, and routers.
CI green: pytest ✅ playwright ✅ Vercel ✅ Neon ✅. Draft PR #717 awaiting merge.

### Bugs fixed (commit `3c11717`)

| File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `src/repositories/users_repo.py` | `list_active_users()` SELECT omitted `email_verified`; all returned User objects defaulted to `email_verified=True` regardless of DB state | Added `COALESCE(email_verified, TRUE)` as column 8; accessed as `row[7]` |
| `src/repositories/audit_repo.py` | `List` used in function signatures (`log_profile_hydration`, `_db_write_profile_hydration`) but not imported; `typing.get_type_hints()` would raise `NameError` | Added `List` to `from typing import …` |
| `src/api/auth.py` | Duplicate `response.delete_cookie()` call in `register()` (lines 580-583 were dead code, identical to lines 482-485) | Removed second call and its comment |
| `tests/test_users_scheduler.py` | Mock fixture rows were 7-element tuples; crashed with `IndexError` after `users_repo` fix added 8th column | Updated both fixture rows to 8-element tuples (added `True` for `email_verified`) |

### Issues documented (require separate PRs — do NOT fix without explicit scope)

| Issue | Location | Risk | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime DDL bypasses migration system | `audit_repo.py`: `_db_write_learning_signal`, `_db_write_profile_hydration`, `_db_write_permission_check` create tables at runtime | Creates untracked tables (`learning_signals_audit`, `profile_hydration_audit`, `permission_check_audit`) outside Neon migration ledger; DDL in hot path blocks connections | Move to numbered migrations; remove runtime DDL |
| Unbounded `_DEDUP_CACHE` memory growth | `audit_repo.py` module-level `_DEDUP_CACHE` dict | Entries only evicted on lookup; under continuous action logging the dict grows without bound | Add periodic sweep or cap size in `_mem_seed` |
| Safety patterns too broad | `rico_safety.py`: `PRIVACY_RISK_PATTERNS` contains `r"password"`, `HARASSMENT_OR_ILLEGAL_PATTERNS` contains `r"bypass"` | Blocks legitimate queries ("how do I reset my password?", "bypass this section of my CV") | Narrow regexes with word-boundary and context anchors; add regression test suite |
| No password complexity enforcement | `src/api/auth.py` `register()` and `reset_password()` | Users can set single-character passwords | Add length + complexity check at registration and reset |
| No JWT revocation after password reset | `src/api/auth.py` | Old sessions remain valid after password change | Implement token blacklist or rotating JWT family ID |
| `mark_webhook_event_processed` type mismatch | `src/rico_db.py` | Accepts `Optional[str]` for `user_id` but DB column is UUID FK; silent failure when non-UUID string passed | Add UUID validation or change signature to `Optional[UUID]` |

### Migration / DB state (2026-06-21)
- Migration `030_action_audit_log_hardening.sql` — **applied + verified** in production Neon
  (append-only trigger `tgtype=58`; INSERT works; UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE rejected).
- Migration `021_user_job_context_alt_url.sql` — **applied** (was drift; issue #710 closed).
- **Drift remaining (issue #711, NOT applied):** `005` `pipeline_runs` table; `011`
  `idx_rico_recommendations_user_job_unique`. Numbered migrations are applied manually (no
  deploy-time runner) — systemic root cause.
- Neon production password **rotated** 2026-06-21.
- Full handoff: `AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-06-21-action-audit-rollout-complete.md`.

### Career OS roadmap — reconciled status (2026-06-21)
Verified against live code: milestones **01–03, 05, 06, 07, 08 are built/shipped**; **CAREER-OS-04
(universal intake / attachment analysis) is the only remaining end-to-end gap** (backend
`document_classifier.py` exists but `attachment_analysis` is not populated into chat responses and
has no frontend card). Details + evidence: `AI_WORKSPACE/HANDOFFS/2026-06-21-career-os-roadmap-status.md`.
The roadmap handoff `2026-06-20-rico-career-os-roadmap.md` predates this build progress.

## P0 Context-Loss Bugs — RESOLVED (2026-06-19, PR #660 + #661)

Four adversarial QA failures fixed and merged to main. Root cause: `RICO_MEMORY_BACKEND=postgres`
sets `_JSON_WRITE_ENABLED=False`, silently neutering all in-process context storage in production.

| Bug | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| BUG-A | Ordinal follow-up ("Open the second one") → "No recent job search" | DB fallback in `_handle_job_detail`; `get_recent_matches()` added to `user_job_context_repo` |
| BUG-B | Bare company name ("Majid Al Futtaim") → "not a job role" | Company-name check against recent context + DB before emitting unknown-role error |
| BUG-C | "Give me the URL" misrouted to search | Extended `_OPEN_APPLY_LINK_RE` to match natural language URL requests |
| BUG-D | Apply link silently absent in job detail | `source_url` fallback + explicit "No apply link available" notice |

Also: `_store_search_matches_context` now calls `upsert_matches` on every search so results
persist to Neon across workers and process restarts (#660). Duplicate call removed in #661.

**Live QA validation (2026-06-19):** BUG-A and BUG-B confirmed working against production
Render endpoint. BUG-C and BUG-D code-confirmed (egress throttle prevented full E2E).
23 unit tests in `tests/test_p0_context_bugs.py` — all passing in CI.

## BUG-04 Unauthorized Profile Mutation — RESOLVED (2026-06-19)

**Symptom:** Three code paths silently wrote to Neon via `upsert_profile` without explicit
user consent: (A) `profile_update` intent persisted before confirming; (B)
`_target_role_search_response` appended searched role to `target_roles` on every search;
(C) `resolver._hydrate_from_chat` NER-inferred fields (cities/skills/roles/industries) were
persisted to DB from chat context.

**Fix (PR #655, merged `f4bacfa`, 2026-06-19T15:51Z):**
- **Fix A:** `profile_update` intent now stashes prefs as `_pending_field="confirm_profile_update"`,
  shows a before-save prompt, and calls `upsert_profile` only on affirmative reply. New
  `_format_pref_changes` helper. `_resolve_pending_field` handles confirm/cancel/pass-through.
- **Fix B:** Removed `upsert_profile` call from `_target_role_search_response`. Searching a
  role no longer promotes it to a standing `target_role`.
- **Fix C:** `resolver.py` snapshots 4 chat-inferable fields pre-NER, computes `_chat_added`
  delta, strips only that delta from the DB write. In-memory profile for the current request
  retains NER enrichment. CV/Jotform/action-derived values unaffected.
- 13 new tests in `tests/test_bug04_profile_mutation.py`.
- `test_p0_trust_fixes.py::test_concrete_profile_update_*` updated to assert ask-first behavior
  (old test was asserting the bug).

**Verification:** CI green (pytest ✅ playwright ✅ Vercel ✅). Zero new failures vs main
baseline (115 pre-existing failures unchanged). Production confirmed at `f4bacfa` via Vercel.

## BUG-03 Google-Intermediary Link — RESOLVED (2026-06-19)

**Symptom:** Job cards showed `google.com/search?...` as the apply/alt link because
`_format_match` was promoting `job_google_link` into `apply_url`/`source_url` without
stripping the Google intermediary.

**Fix (PR #651 `8685458` + hotfix PR #652 `b0807c0`, 2026-06-19):**
- `source_url` fallback no longer accepts Google search/URL links.
- `alt_link` Google intermediary cleared at write time.

**DB cleanup:** Read-only Neon sweep confirmed zero Google URLs in `jobs` or
`user_job_context`. One `rico_job_recommendations` row (Senior HSE Manager — Events /
Talent BluePrint, `job_key=6b1e9b6fdca6ad6b`) had empty `apply_url`/`source_url` —
contamination was display-only, already fixed at write time by #651/#652. No DB write needed.

---

## BUG-02 A/B/C/D Letter-Choice Routing — RESOLVED (2026-06-19)

**Symptom:** When Rico presented lettered options (A/B/C/D), user selecting "A" was routed
to option B, "B" to C, etc. — off-by-one in the index lookup.

**Fix (PR #649, merged `631ce7d`, 2026-06-19):** Zero-vs-one-based index corrected in the
letter-choice router. CI green on merge.

---

## BUG-01 Cover-Letter Company-Search Guard — RESOLVED (2026-06-19)

**Symptom:** Cover letter prompts like
"Draft me a cover letter for the HSE MANAGER - DATA CENTERS role at Dutco Group"
triggered a company job search instead of generating a cover letter.

**Root cause:** Pre-classifier `_COMPANY_SEARCH_RE` pattern-2
(`\b(?:jobs?|roles?|vacancies|openings?|positions?)\s+at\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z]`) matched
"role at Dutco Group" before the cover-letter slot extractor ran.

**Fix (PR #648, merged `40636ba6ed2fd15cf135ef38030c6e1d2641ecab`, 2026-06-19T09:34Z):**
- New early-exit block: when `_COVER_LETTER_COMMAND_RE` matches, extract slots and
  either generate the letter (title + company present) or ask only for the missing
  field — before `_COMPANY_SEARCH_RE` is evaluated.
- Belt-and-suspenders guard: `_COMPANY_SEARCH_RE` check now also requires
  `not _COVER_LETTER_COMMAND_RE.search(message)`.
- 5 new regression tests in `TestBug01CoverLetterCompanySearchGuard`
  (15/15 total in `test_cover_letter_slot_extraction.py`).

**Verification chain:**
- Pre-merge: 15/15 tests PASS.
- Render deploy run #29 (09:34Z, SHA `40636ba`): all steps PASS, `/health` 200.
- bug01-smoke.yml run #1 (27818302534, 09:45Z): **4/4 PASS**
  - `/version` = `40636ba6ed2fd15cf135ef38030c6e1d2641ecab` ✅
  - Cover-letter smoke: `type=onboarding` (not `job_results`) ✅
  - Company-search regression: `type=onboarding` (not `draft_message`/`cover_letter_prompt`) ✅
  - `/health` = 200 ✅
- Manual app smoke (user-confirmed 2026-06-19): "Draft me a cover letter for the HSE
  MANAGER - DATA CENTERS role at Dutco Group" → Rico drafted cover letter, no job_results,
  no Dutco company search, no unrelated apply links. ✅
- `/flow` contamination: none — smoke session had no profile, no jobs surfaced or tracked.
- bug01-smoke.yml cleaned up from main (commit `3e997073`).

## #644 Production Incident — RESOLVED (2026-06-19)

**Symptom:** All DB-backed endpoints broken after #638 merged to main and deployed.
`POST /pipeline/reminders` returned `{"status":"error"}`. `/rico/profile`,
`/applications`, `/subscription` also affected.

**Root cause:** `src/rico_db.py` `connect()` did `conn._rico_pool = pool`. psycopg2
connections have no `__dict__`; this raised `AttributeError` on every `db.connect()` call.

**Fix (PR #644, merged `26124ed180a77658be21cfa499e5629bd6a816ed`, 2026-06-19T07:53Z):**
- `connect()` no longer assigns any attribute to the connection object.
- Returns a direct per-request connection (proven pre-overhaul behavior).
- `_return_or_close()` closes directly.
- Regression tests added: `tests/test_rico_db_connect.py` (4 tests, slots-only fake conn).

**Why pooling disabled (not just patched):** pool is also incompatible with the many
`with db.connect() as conn:` callers (subscription_repo / applications_repo / profile_repo)
that never return connections to a pool. Re-enabling pooling needs a caller-wide
acquire/release refactor — tracked as a separate follow-up. Pool scaffolding left in place,
unused.

**Full verification chain:**
- Pre-merge tests: test_rico_db_connect (4) + test_followup_reminders (10) +
  test_application_lifecycle (21) = 35 passed. py_compile clean.
- Render deploy run #27 (07:55Z, SHA `26124ed`): all steps PASS, `/health` 200, `/version` confirmed.
- Render deploy run #28 (08:01Z, SHA `26124ed`): all steps PASS, `/health` 200, `/version` confirmed.
- followup-smoke.yml run #2 (08:02Z, SHA `26124ed`): **9/9 PASS** (first post-#644 smoke).
- Cron double-fire (cron-test.yml, dispatch run 27813559291):
  run 1 `status="ok"`, run 2 `status="ok"` (idempotent). cron-test.yml then removed.

## #355 Follow-up Reminders Phase 1 — COMPLETE (2026-06-19)

All Phase 1 gates passed:

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| Migration `027_followup_reminders.sql` applied to Neon | ✅ confirmed |
| `RICO_CRON_SECRET` set on Render + GitHub secret | ✅ confirmed |
| Production backend live at `26124ed` | ✅ `/health` 200, `/version` `26124ed` |
| `POST /pipeline/reminders` returns `status="ok"` | ✅ two consecutive Cron runs confirmed |
| followup-smoke.yml 9/9 PASS | ✅ run #1 (`27810675201`) and run #2 (`27813425034`) |
| DB layer restored (no `_rico_pool` error) | ✅ #644 merged + deployed |

**Render Cron configured (do not change command):**
```
Schedule: 0 4 * * *
Command:  curl -fsS -X POST -H "X-Cron-Secret: $RICO_CRON_SECRET" \
          https://rico-job-automation-api.onrender.com/api/v1/pipeline/reminders
```

**Phase 2: not started.** (#640 on hold — do not merge. #641 merged 2026-06-20, see below.)

## System overhaul v1+v2 — merged to main (PR #638, commit `9c003a7`)

| Change | Status |
|---|---|
| Telegram DM replies fixed (`rico_telegram_webhook.py`) | ✅ on main |
| Telegram `update_id` deduplication | ✅ on main |
| 12 DB indexes via `028_performance_indexes.sql` (applied at startup) | ✅ on main |
| Jobs "Load more" pagination (`apps/web/app/jobs/page.tsx`) | ✅ on main |
| DB connection pooling (`src/rico_db.py`) | ⚠️ scaffolding present, pooling **disabled by #644** |
| Email pre-fill after verification (`verify-email/page.tsx`) | ✅ on main |
| `initialEmail` prop + Suspense on login page | ✅ on main |
| TagInputField chips for profile page | ✅ on main |

**028_performance_indexes startup warning — FIXED in PR #662:**
`job_id` → `searched_at DESC` in the `user_job_context` index.
`user_job_context` never had a `job_id` column; the correct column is `searched_at`.

## On-hold PRs

- **PR #640** — on hold, awaiting explicit approval. Do not merge.
- ~~**PR #641** — on hold~~ → ✅ **MERGED** `6fac4c0` (2026-06-20T07:59Z): v4 navy/indigo
  design tokens, live + smoke-PASS. Addresses audit item 6-A (see TASK-028).

## Security — credential redaction (2026-06-19)

An old Neon connection string (`authenticator:npg_R8hdwAMu9cOs`) was found committed in
`docs/archive/AUDIT_REPORT_2026-05-14.md`. Redacted via PR #656 (merged `e104135`,
2026-06-19). The credential is believed rotated/invalid (different user, different password
from current). Current chat-exposed credential (`npg_DI5SJWxO8wVj`, `neondb_owner`) was
**not** in the repo. Rotation of the current password is left to the owner (Neon console →
Reset password → update Render `DATABASE_URL` → redeploy).

**Note:** `git filter-repo` purge of the old credential from history is out of scope —
requires a coordinated force-push. Track separately if needed.

## #618 Reconciliation — complete (2026-06-19)

Status index posted as GitHub comment (issuecomment-4753155540). #654 absorbed-observations
note posted (issuecomment-4753155919). #618 remains open as the living tracker for 8 open
UX tasks. Workflow-class items moved to #654. Resolved items checked off.

**8 open tasks remaining in #618:**
TASK-010 Pipeline relevance guard (P1) · TASK-011 Match-score explanation (P2) ·
TASK-013 Application Pipeline V1 status alignment (P1) · TASK-014 Queue Arabic empty state (P2) ·
TASK-015 Pipeline notes/activity log (P2) · TASK-016 Profile completeness vs readiness (P3,

## Sidebar status-widget retry (TASK-027 / PR #658) — DONE + smoke-PASS (2026-06-20)

Sidebar READINESS/PIPELINE widgets no longer cache failed cold-start loads (the "blank grey
boxes on navigate-back" bug). Merged `712be79` via **PR #658**, which replaced #653 — that
branch had 46 stale commits already on main and was **closed/superseded**. Production smoke
PASS 2026-06-20 (full table on PR #658, issuecomment-4756899519). Tracked as
**TASK-20260619-027**.

> Earlier chat shorthand called this "TASK-024" — that is incorrect; TASK-024 is BUG-04. The
> sidebar fix had no ledger ID until TASK-027 was added.

## UI/UX live-audit backlog (2026-06-19) — logged as TASK-028

The 2026-06-19 live production UI/UX audit (`docs/audits/ui-ux-live-audit-2026-06-19.md`,
shipped via #658) produced 20 prioritized recommendations across `/command`, `/flow`,
`/profile`, `/upload`, `/settings`, `/subscription`, and the sidebar. They are now tracked as a
backlog in **TASK-20260619-028**. Item 1-D (sidebar widgets) is already DONE (TASK-027); each
remaining item spins into its own scoped TASK-NNN when picked up. Top pick per the audit:
**1-A** (clickable option buttons — biggest UX win for least effort).

## BUG-05 Public-Chat Onboarding Loop — RESOLVED (2026-06-19)

**Symptom:** Every message sent from the `/command` (Ask Rico) public chat after the first
returned the identical "Welcome to Rico AI. Upload your CV or tell me your target role…"
string. Chat never progressed, ignored conversation history, and never routed to real AI.

**Root cause (three-part):**
1. `IntentRouter` routes "Give me 3 interview questions", fully-specified profile strings,
   and prompt-injection attempts to the legacy classifier (`should_use_ai=False`), not AI.
2. The legacy classifier's `process_message` checks `profile is None` → skips `upsert_profile`
   + `set_onboarding_status` when `_persist=False` (all public sessions) → always falls back
   to the onboarding welcome string. Since nothing is ever persisted for public users, every
   turn repeats the welcome.
3. When the streaming endpoint returns a `"done"` event without any SSE tokens (legacy path),
   `streamStarted=false` but `responseApplied=true`; the `if (!streamStarted)` guard in the
   frontend fired a redundant second `sendChatPublic` call.

**Fix (PR on branch `claude/ai-workspace-review-vtdjrb`, 2026-06-19):**
- **Fix A** (`src/services/chat_service.py`): Added `_force_ai` gate — when legacy path is
  chosen AND `profile is None` AND `ctx.can_persist_profile is False`, redirect to
  `_conversational_ai_reply` so public users get real responses instead of the welcome loop.
- **Fix B** (`src/api/routers/rico_chat.py`): `rico_chat_stream_public` only takes the
  non-streaming legacy path when `profile is not None`. No-profile public users fall through
  to AI streaming.
- **Fix C** (`apps/web/app/command/page.tsx`): Streaming fallback changed from
  `if (!streamStarted)` to `if (!streamStarted && !responseApplied)` to prevent double API
  call when the legacy path already applied the response via the `"done"` event.
- 7 unit tests in `tests/test_public_chat_no_profile_loop.py` covering the full routing
  matrix (public/no-profile/legacy → AI; public/no-profile/AI → AI; public/with-profile →
  legacy; auth/no-profile → legacy; auth/AI → AI).

**Routing matrix after fix:**

| Session | Profile | Router decision | Route taken |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public | None | Legacy | **AI** (new _force_ai gate) |
| Public | None | AI | AI (unchanged) |
| Public | present | Legacy | Legacy (unchanged) |
| Public | present | AI | AI (unchanged) |
| Auth | None | Legacy | Legacy (can persist state) |
| Auth | None | AI | AI |

## CI health

- QA Tests (pytest + playwright): green on main (`e104135`) and on PR #717 branch (`3c11717`).
- followup-smoke.yml: 9/9 PASS on `26124ed` (run #2, 2026-06-19).
- bug01-smoke.yml: **4/4 PASS** on `40636ba` (run #1, 2026-06-19). **Removed** after one-shot use.
- Render deploy: **auto-deploys on every push to `main`** via `deploy-render.yml` (PR #686 added the
  `push: [main]` trigger). The workflow fires the Render deploy hook, then polls `/version` until the
  deployed commit (`RENDER_GIT_COMMIT`) matches the merged SHA before it passes — so a green deploy run
  proves the **new** backend is serving, not merely that the old one is healthy. `workflow_dispatch` is
  retained for on-demand redeploys. (Render has no native auto-deploy on this service — the workflow is
  the mechanism; the earlier "auto-deploys from main" note in #668 was incorrect until #686.)
  Note: `/health` and `/version` return 403 from external networks (Render network-level policy) —
  verify via the GitHub Actions deploy run or the Render dashboard (not WebFetch / curl from CI containers).
- cron-test.yml: **removed** (one-off #644 verification, cleaned up 2026-06-19).

## Next product roadmap order

Do not start without explicit scope and branch assignment.

1. ~~**#653 (TASK-024)** — sidebar status widget retry~~ — DONE: merged via #658 (`712be79`),
   production smoke-PASS 2026-06-20. Tracked as TASK-20260619-027.
2. **TASK-013 Application Pipeline V1** (P1) — end-to-end application submission with approval
   gate, audit log, Telegram confirmation. Needs dedicated issue + branch.
3. **TASK-010 Pipeline relevance guard** (P1) — pre-filter pipeline results against active
   profile before scoring. Needs dedicated issue + branch.
4. **#355 Phase 2** — per-user interval settings + Telegram DM notifications.
5. **#356 Inbox Intelligence** — design-only; connector design doc (#566) on `main`.
6. ~~**028_performance_indexes cleanup**~~ — fixed in #662 (2026-06-19).
7. **DB pooling re-enable** — caller-wide acquire/release refactor; separate PR after 028 fix.

## Carry-over engineering backlog

- **JWT revocation after password reset** — old sessions stay valid after reset (documented in #717 audit)
- **Password complexity validation on register/reset** — no enforcement today (documented in #717 audit)
- **Runtime DDL in `audit_repo.py`** — 3 tables created outside migration system; move to numbered migrations (documented in #717 audit)
- **`_DEDUP_CACHE` unbounded growth** in `audit_repo.py` — only evicted on lookup (documented in #717 audit)
- **Safety regex over-breadth** — `r"password"` and `r"bypass"` block legitimate user queries; needs narrowing + regression tests (documented in #717 audit)
- **`mark_webhook_event_processed` type mismatch** in `rico_db.py` — `Optional[str]` for UUID FK (documented in #717 audit)
- Per-user rate limiting on /apply endpoint
- Race condition in guest→auth identity merge
- Settings page keywords tag input (same UX as profile TagInputField)

## Operating target

Use one repeatable workflow:

1. Scope one task.
2. Write or update the task in `TASKS.md`.
3. Generate one handoff brief.
4. Assign exactly one writer for the branch.
5. Require implementation notes and verification evidence.
6. Record final decisions and remaining risks.

## Quality gates

Use the applicable gates for each task:

- backend tests
- frontend build
- local smoke checks
- deployment verification when applicable
- no secrets changed
- no unrelated files changed
- rollback plan included
